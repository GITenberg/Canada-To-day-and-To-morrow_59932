<h1 class='nobreak' id='t223'>CHAPTER I<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE DOMINION’S DESTINY</span></h1>

<p class='pindent'>For those who mark the current of events, Canada’s
great destiny is written plain. Canada in a few decades
must possess more people and more realised wealth than
Great Britain. Whether the centre of Imperial control
will then cross the Atlantic is a point on which prophecies
differ. Memories enshrined in Westminster Abbey
will tend to conserve the ancient seat of government.
Yet there is weight in the surmise that the logic of
numbers will ultimately prevail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canada’s future is foretold in the past growth and
present might of the United States. The same traditions,
the same climate (over areas of chief significance),
the same resources, and—most important of all—the
same method of expansion, will produce, and are
producing, the same result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history of the United States is contained in
one word—immigration. That country has absorbed
myriad migrants from northern regions of the eastern
hemisphere; and it has absorbed most of them in recent
times. Screw steamships are responsible. The population
of the United States was about 17,000,000 when
the first regular Atlantic service was founded by Samuel
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
Cunard—the father of modern America. Only seventeen
millions—less than the present population of Brazil!
Such was the American nation when Charles Dickens
visited it. The growth of population has gained in
momentum with the increase and improvement of liners.
We now have 92,000,000 cousins. Twenty millions—or
nearly a quarter of the huge nation—date no farther
back than Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee. The
numerical strength of the Republic has more than
doubled since the Tichborne trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immigration, of course, rests upon advertising—a
process which is far from being as modern as it sounds,
the word occurring in the Bible (Numbers xxiv. 14
and Ruth iv. 4). The United States, ever since their
foundation, have been sedulously advertised throughout
Europe, partly by books and news-sheets, mainly by
private correspondence. The prosperous settler writes
to relatives and friends in the Old Country, urging
them to come out; and such letters are the most potent
stimulus that immigration can receive. They constitute
advertising in its most convincing form. They
represent an ever-expanding force working silently and
unseen. I talked of this matter with Mr. J. Obed Smith—an
authority—and he had the right word for what
takes place. Those who go in advance “beckon” to
those who follow. The United States are still receiving
about a million immigrants every year—the result
of beckoning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a change has come over the transatlantic
exodus. Previously there was only one destination—now
there are two. Down to a few years ago the
average person, when he spoke or thought of emigrating,
had only the United States in his mind. It was
called “going to America.” Nowadays the word
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
emigration, when you see it in print, is apt to suggest Canada.
Of course there is no abatement in the great automatic
movement that is of cumulative force. The millions
who were beckoned to the United States are themselves
beckoning other millions. But the thousands who have
gone to Canada are also beckoning—and with more
reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simultaneously the attractions of the Dominion are
being proclaimed through the machinery of publicity.
Modern means of stimulating public interest, no less
than modern means of quick, safe and cheap transportation,
give the present day a great advantage, so far as
populating a distant country is concerned, over an era
when newspapers cost fourpence and passenger ships
were innocent of steam. When the United States were
at an early stage of development, and urgently needing
people, there was no halfpenny press through which to
communicate with the democracy of Europe, for the
democracy of Europe had not learnt to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canada was discovered by Canada about fifteen
years ago, by the United States a little later, by England—well,
England is discovering Canada now. For we
are a slow, if sure, people. One day England will discover
the British Empire. Meanwhile we are ruled by
a generation which was taught at school that Canada
is one of our Colonies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In thinking of Canada the earnest and logical man
in the street has been led inevitably into a gigantic misconception.
As a matter of fact, without a sense of
humour it is difficult to make head or tail of the history
of North America. Every schoolboy has been taught
that Canada existed before the United States were
created. Yet the United States have grown to be a
mighty and wealthy nation of 92,000,000 people; while
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
Canada, with a slightly larger area, still has a population
of only 8,000,000. Naturally enough, the man
in the street concluded there was something wrong
somewhere with Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One can, of course, only elucidate the position by
stating facts which seem, on the face of them, quaint,
not to say funny. As the upshot of a fierce war that
took place a century and a quarter ago, part of North
America became an independent country, while another
part remained in allegiance to the English sovereign;
and the curious circumstance has to be noted that, ever
since then, Great Britain has been sending out millions
of men, not to the country she retained, but to the
country she lost. To be strictly accurate, those people
were not sent—they went. They succumbed to the spell
of the newly arisen United States. As though to heap
coals of fire on the heads of those who had revolted from
our rule and beaten us in battle, we set to work to make
them mighty among the nations of the earth; British
contributions to that end heavily outweighing those of
other peoples. Meanwhile—there being apparently no
end to our self-abnegation—we were content to leave
our own part of North America practically unrecruited
by emigrants from the British Isles. Nay—the daughter
becoming, as would seem, infected by the mother’s
magnanimity—our own part of North America made
generous contributions to the neighbouring population,
it being the strange fact that during the past fifty years
3,250,000 people have gone from Canada to the United
States—indigence sparing of its poverty to increase the
riches of affluence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of those developments, which wear so quixotic an
aspect in the retrospect, the explanation lies, of course,
in the truism that unity is strength. For nearly a
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
century North America consisted of two sections—the
United States and the Ununited Provinces. Union, consolidation,
federation—those are the masterful words in
the story of nations. What sort of position in the world
would Essex have attained had Essex acted independently
of Cumberland and the other English counties?
Where would Perthshire have been without the political
link with Cork? Similarly, how would Massachusetts
have ever become a big power single-handed, and who
would care a rap for the Stars and Stripes if they waved
only over Pennsylvania? The separate States might
have asked for people and respect, but their individual
voices would not have carried across the Atlantic. It
was only because they spoke in unison that they were
audible all over the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here we come to close quarters with the misconception
still lingering in the popular mind. The
man in the street has confused two Canadas—historic
Canada, which dated back to the sixteenth century
and comprised only portions of the existing Eastern
provinces, and modern Canada, which extends from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, and is less than forty years
old. It is as though the name England had originally
applied merely to portions of Kent and Sussex. The
federation of the distinct countries of British North
America began in 1867, and was not completed until
1873. Thus the reason why Canada did not, until recent
years, begin to grow is because Canada, until recent
years, did not exist. Previously, owing to circumstances
that will be traced in a later chapter, little was
known of the bulk of the country. The setting up of
the Federal Government opened the way to knowledge.
That knowledge is still incomplete, being representative
rather than general. But already—as this book will, I
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
hope, help to prove—there is justification for the belief
that the attractions and resources of Canada are not
inferior to those of the United States .&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, being through with our prologue of broad
facts, let us pass to personal experiences of the voyage
to Canada. That week’s imprisonment in a travelling
hotel is, surely, the ideal holiday. Thrice have I crossed
in the saloon and once in the steerage—and a button
for the difference! In the great liners of to-day there
are comfortable quarters and wholesome meals for
everybody, whether he pays £18, £10s. 5s., or £5 15s.
As a rule I find third-class emigrants more interesting
to talk to than first-class poker-players. On the other
hand, grand pianos are preferable to concertinas, and
it is wondrous pleasant, when at sea, to stroll on Turkish
carpets amid alcoves of growing ferns, palms and
flowers; while I personally am alive to the advantages
of a spacious smoking-room panelled in carved oak, a
well-stocked library, and a writing lounge furnished
with necessaries and taste (to glance at a few features
of such floating temples of luxury as the <span class='it'>Royal George</span>).
But air, sea and sky—the common property of all
classes—are of chief account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me dip among the memories of my first crossing,
which happened nearly nine years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two days our ship was followed by a dozen
gulls—strong birds, with yellow bodies, and having
black tips to their long wings. By day they hovered in
our wake, eager for whatsoever the cook might discard
through a porthole; by night—I was invited to believe—they
snatched a little slumber in the rigging. But
those sturdy aviators did not accompany us all the way
to Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You cannot see, you can only infer, that the
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
Atlantic Ocean is large. At no time in any direction
does the eye behold more sea than is visible from
Hastings pier. During the long, luxurious day and
all through the night the vessel goes on, on, and still
on. The throbbing propeller makes with splashing
water the music that lulls you to sleep at night, that
greets your waking in the morning. For ever the sea
is rushing by in frothy confusion. We career through
a path mottled with foam. Between the whirling
splashes and streaks of white the eye pierces a slatey-green,
with the myriad tiny bubbles ascending as a
grey cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You look in grateful silence upon the Atlantic skies—purples
and lemon-yellow in the east, gold and
flaming crimson in the west. Later joys are the moonshine
and the phosphorous glowing on the busy,
musical, unseen waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon a little bird came to us, perching
awhile on the bridge stairs. I did not see him, but they
told me of his grey feathers fluttering deranged in the
breeze, and the balance of testimony proclaimed him
a sparrow. Wondrous welcome little visitor from the
land. For to live nearly a week on the boundless sea
is to find yourself with tender recollections of meadow
and dell, of oak trees and the bumble bee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not always did white crests figure in the wide
circumference. Once the surface sobered to a polished
blue, and as we loitered in the burning sunshine the
decks felt hot underfoot. Waggish Nature chose that
tropical interlude for an Arctic exhibition. We saw
icebergs and whales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this enlightened age it may seem superfluous to
describe either. I shall give my impressions of both,
and for this reason: each was wholly otherwise than
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
I had expected to find it. The whale at sea is very
unlike a whale. In our first experience—a creature some
two miles away—again and again we saw the jet of
water rise as a column of white fluffiness out of a little
area of surface commotion. It was easy to infer some
animal was causing the upheaval, but for long he
abstained from presenting any part of his anatomy to
our view. At last he so far satisfied our curiosity as to
show us a few yards of the top of his back. The oblong,
rounded piece of conspicuous blackness performed a sort
of greasy curve, a large and handsome fin travelled
round the upper edge, and then Mr. Whale, again
wholly immersed, playfully re-engaged in squirting part
of the Atlantic Ocean up in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Icebergs in the sunshine are superlatively beautiful.
I had expected an iceberg to look like ice. It suggests,
rather, a mountain of loaf sugar or alabaster. It is
white with the tender, dazzling whiteness of a swan’s
breast. Its surface is of milky, silky snow. Moulded
in soft contour, it is rich in fanciful, protruding shapes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A distant berg, floating towards Newfoundland, was
revealed in our glasses as two prodigious Egyptian
pyramids. Another was half a mile away, aground
off Belle Isle. It exhibited, as a conspicuous feature on
the windward side, a great seal snorting the air. When
we came to leeward the entire mass was seen to be a
headless lion, the hind legs adjusted to a squatting
attitude, the spinal vertebræ visible up the mountain
slope of the creature’s back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One’s first impressions of Quebec yield a joy that cannot
be recaptured on subsequent visits; yet the better
you get to know that old city, the more you love it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no moon shining when, nine years ago,
a ship that had voyaged for days across the sea, and
for hours through the night, brought me suddenly into
view of an escarpment aglow with myriad friendly
lights. And soon a quaint old Frenchman in a white
hat was driving me in a quaint old carriage up quaint,
steep streets where lamp-light gave glimpses of walls
of naked rock and mellow brickwork, of venerable
gabled houses with green shutters, of noble buildings
grey with antiquity, and of stately monuments standing
amid leafy gardens, with here and there a moss-grown
cannon peeping out of its crumbling embrasure. Nor
was it long before, in the garden of the Château Frontenac—that
huge, handsome hotel—I was stealing
nasturtium blooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day revealed how beautiful is the situation of
Quebec. Standing on Dufferin Terrace—that superb
promenade running along the brow of the cliff—you
look out upon the great blue river sweeping through a
landscape of purple mountains. Quebec has been well
defined as “a small bit of mediæval Europe perched
upon a rock,” and Charles Dickens wrote of “its giddy
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
heights, its citadel suspended, as it were, in air; its
picturesque steep streets and frowning gateways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old French capital is a pleasure resort.
Thousands of American tourists visit it every year;
golf is played on the battlefield where Wolfe fell
victorious; and the city’s ice carnivals and other winter
frolics are famous. The old French capital is also of
growing commercial importance, and its industries
must receive a great impetus from the new St. Lawrence
bridge—the largest cantilever structure in the
world—and the projected dock extensions. But the
old French capital commands admiration mainly for
its age and its associations. Of all the fine Canadian
cities it is the finest and the least Canadian. Quebec
even possesses two slums—the only two slums, I verily
believe, in the entire Dominion; and they are far too
picturesque to be demolished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is surprising to find such an obvious piece of the
Old World at the threshold of the New World; and
Quebec’s antiquity is emphasised when, on travelling
through the Dominion, one notes the modern aspect of
the other cities. Clues to that contrast will be found
in Canada’s lop-sided history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, to look at the Dominion through the historian’s
telescope is to be baffled by a picture that will
not get into focus. An eastern portion is full of background,
middle-distance and foreground; southern and
western strips reveal nothing but foreground; a central
northern region has detail only in the middle distance;
and the bulk of the area is equally without definition
here, there and beyond. In other words, one part of
the Dominion has much history, other parts have some,
and many parts have none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I have already hinted, the word “Canada” is a
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
territorial ambiguity, since it applies both to a little old
country (with a history commencing in the year 1000,
when Icelandic settlers in Greenland discovered Labrador)
and to a large new country (with a history commencing
in 1873, when Confederation was completed). In reviewing
the evolution of the Dominion, therefore, it is
difficult to keep history in anything like a proportionate
relation to geography. Ancient Canada, being so
rich in material for the historian, is apt to monopolise
nearly all his space. Beginning with events contemporaneous
with the Saxon era in England, he plods
through the centuries, peppering his pages with memorable
dates, unrolling a long scroll of illustrious names,
tracing the varying fortunes of two races and three
nationalities in their struggles for supremacy, and recording
bloody battles innumerable. When he has
done all that, he finds himself with latitude for only
vague and brief mention of the bulk of the Dominion;
and his readers, thinking they have been reading a
history of Canada (whereas they have only been reading
a history of a fraction of Canada) are left with an unfortunate
impression that Canada is an old, instead of a
new, country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To follow the course of events, one must eliminate
existing geographical boundaries from one’s mind, and
think of eastern North America (stretching along the
present seaboards of Canada and the United States)
as a whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Voyagers from England and Portugal got there
first, towards the close of the fifteenth century; but
France and Spain took the lead in forming colonies.
The situation soon resolved itself into a rivalry between
the French and the English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1535 Jacques Cartier explored the St. Lawrence
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
(which he named), and advanced as far as an Indian
town that he christened Mont Royal (since corrupted
into Montreal); and afterwards there came other
French expeditions, whose attempts to found settlements
were frustrated by Indian hostility. At the
opening of the seventeenth century, however, Samuel
de Champlain established in Acadia (now Nova Scotia)
the first European colony that took root within the
boundaries of the present Dominion; and in 1608 he
visited the St. Lawrence and founded the City of
Quebec. Thus was brought into being “New France”—a
large territory which included eastern Canada of
to-day and stretched south across the existing international
boundary line. There was also a rival colony,
known as “New England,” which extended north from
Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The struggle between Great Britain and France
continued, with intervals of peace and with an ebb and
flow of fortunes, for a century and a half; and in the
history of this period the most inspiring chapter is that
which tells of the unflinching zeal and dauntless courage
of Roman Catholic priests who, penetrating to the
interior of the country, sought to carry Christianity and
civilisation to the Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) the possession of
Hudson Bay (the history of which I shall glance at
later), Acadia and Newfoundland was definitely vested
with Great Britain, France retaining authority over a
vast stretch of territory. Thirty years afterwards the
war of the Austrian Succession justified a resumption
of hostilities, which were interrupted by the Treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle. A few years later the two Powers
reached the final stage of their long contest for mastery
in North America; and, following Wolfe’s victory at
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
Quebec in 1759, French rule in Canada came to an
end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the French people remained, and their descendants
remain, in Canada; and their presence there—those
two million fine, happy, prosperous French-Canadians,
who combine loyalty to the British Empire with a love
for France—supplies, I think, the noblest object-lesson
in international fraternity anywhere to be found on the
earth. It is an object-lesson that grows in distinctness
as our eyes open to new possibilities of unarmed amity;
for at last we are slowly awakening to the knowledge
that brotherhood is a higher interest of the human race,
and may even call for a loftier type of bravery than
bloodshed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, of course, some little initial unrest in
the Franco-English colony, but this was largely allayed
when, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the Quebec
Act, which restored the French civil code and defined
Canada as extending from Labrador to the Mississippi,
and from the watershed of Hudson Bay to the Ohio—in
other words, as including the present Provinces of
Quebec and Ontario, and a number of States over
which the Stars and Stripes now float. Then came the
War of Independence, which turned our brothers into
our cousins, and caused the Great Lakes to be Canada’s
southern boundary, instead of her waist-belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English population of Canada—far smaller
than the French population—was now increased by the
arrival from the south of 25,000 persons who, loyal to
the old tie with Great Britain, refused their allegiance
to the newly-created United States. French and
English were soon united in a desire to enjoy such
constitutional privileges as had already been granted
to the Maritime Provinces; but while the majority were
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
anxious that their own national traditions should be
followed, the minority wished for institutions modelled
on English lines. The British Government solved the
problem by splitting Canada into two—an Upper
Canada for the English, and a Lower Canada for the
French—and giving to each a Legislature of its own,
though a Legislature in which the people’s representatives
were under the thumb of Crown nominees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The war between the United States and Great
Britain, in 1812-14, exposed the two Canadas and the
Maritime Provinces to a severe ordeal, through which
they came triumphant; and afterwards our French and
English fellow-subjects resumed their agitation for a
full measure of popular government. They went ultimately
to the length of rebellion; and then it was not
long before the Home Government granted their desire.
Friction had occurred between the two Canadas on
questions of revenue, and so, by the Act of 1840 that
conceded a democratic constitution, these two Canadas,
after half a century of separation, were again made into
one Canada under one Legislature; the two halves of
a political whole being now distinguished as Canada
East and Canada West. Happily, however, a clash
of interests arose between the French population and
the English—happily, I say, because it led to the union,
in 1867, of Canada West and Canada East (thence-forward
to be known as the Provinces of Ontario and
Quebec) with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; and
this was the first stage of Confederation, a process
whereby the name “Canada” was transferred to the
great country, stretching from ocean to ocean, which
bids fair to develop wealth and population like the
United States of America, and to become the foremost
nation of the British Empire.
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I have only told, in broad outline, the story of
Eastern Canada—that part of the Dominion which holds
the accumulated interest of stirring vicissitudes experienced
over a period of four hundred years. We will
now turn to the only other part of the Dominion that
has a history stretching back to the Middle Ages. I
refer to the Hudson Bay region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Man is a toy in the hands of Time. Things he
does in one century are apt, in the light of another, to
assume the character of a droll misuse of opportunity.
The early history of the Hudson’s Bay Company tells,
in effect, of men who worked in a rich gold mine and
collected nothing but quartz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1610 Henry Hudson—that glorious, pathetic hero—discovered
the great northern indentation in the map
of Canada; and it was re-discovered overland, about
sixty years later, by two dashing adventurers from
“New France”—Medard de Groseillers and Pierre
Radisson, who returned from Hudson Bay with rich
booty, of which they were despoiled by the authorities
at Quebec. The two indignant Frenchmen went with
the story of their wrongs to France, where they were
treated with laughing contempt. Then they crossed to
England and told our King all about it. Charles II.
(who was staying at Oxford, to avoid the plague of
London) pricked up his ears, and—some of his followers
being minded to invest their money in a promising
business speculation—a Royal Charter was granted
to “Gentlemen Adventurers trading to Hudson’s Bay.”
His Majesty did the thing handsomely while he was
about it; for the Charter gave the Adventurers all the
country and all it contained for all time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was the booty Radisson and Groseillers
(whom, by the way, Charles II. insisted upon calling
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
“Mr. Gooseberry”) had brought from Hudson Bay?
It took the form of 600,000 beaver skins. Resident in
that part of the world are many four-footed creatures
which, because the weather is apt to be cold, are provided
by nature with warm, hairy coats; and the fur
that is a necessary for them is a luxury for man—and
especially for woman. Accordingly, the Adventurers
sent their ships to Hudson Bay for pelts they could turn
into pelf. The actual trapping and skinning was done
by the Indians, from whom the Adventurers’ agents
secured the valuable furs in exchange for tobacco, shot,
brandy, and other commodities of civilisation. Sometimes,
not content with killing the beaver, the mink,
and the silver fox, the Indians killed the Adventurers’
agents, and vice versa; but in a general way the natives
and the visitors traded on a footing of mutual toleration—business
being done on these lines: six beavers for
one blanket, half a pound of beads for one beaver, twelve
buttons or twenty fish-hooks for ditto, and twelve
beavers for one gun. The Hudson’s Bay men built
themselves forts, and their commercial transactions with
the red man were always conducted through a small
wicket in the palisades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor were picturesque touches lacking at the London
end. Prince Rupert was the governor, and for colleagues
he had a committee who, by way of tempering
the austerity of the company’s affairs, permitted occasional
latitude to a festive spirit. Lord Preston having
rendered the company a service, the warehouse keeper
was instructed to deliver “as many black beaver skins
as will make my lord a fine covering for his bedd”; and,
in gratitude for favours from a more exalted quarter,
“two pairs of beaver stockings are ordered for the King
and the Duke of York.” The Adventurers were equally
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
alive to domestic claims on their goodwill, as may be
inferred from orders “to bespeak a cask of canary for ye
governor,” and “a hogshead of claret for ye captains
sailing from Gravesend.”</p>

<p class='caption'> THE ONLY SLUM IN CANADA—LITTLE CHAMPLAIN STREET, QUEBEC </p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the quaintest customs that I found in the
minute books,” writes Agnes C. Laut, the company’s
painstaking historian, “was regarding the home-coming
ships. The money that had accrued from sales during
the ships’ absence was kept in an iron box in the warehouse
on Fenchurch Street. It ranged in amount from
£2,000 to £11,000. To this, only the governor and
deputy-governor had the keys. Banking in the modern
sense of the word was not begun till 1735. When the
ships came in, the strong box was hauled forth and the
crews paid.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;. An average of ten thousand beaver
a year was brought home. Later, otter and mink and
marten became valuable. These, the common furs,
whalebone, ivory, elks’ hoofs and whale blubber made
up the list of the winter sales. Before the days of newspapers,
the lists were posted in the Royal Exchange,
and sales held ‘by candle’ in lieu of the auctioneer’s
hammer—a tiny candle being lighted, pins stuck in at
intervals along the shaft, and bids shouted till the light
burned out. One can guess with what critical caress
the fur fanciers ran their hands over the soft nap of
the silver fox, blowing open the fur to examine the
depth and find whether the pelt had been damaged in
the skinning. Half a dozen of these rare skins from
the fur world meant more than a cargo of beaver. What
was it, anyway—this creature; rare as twentieth-century
radium, that was neither blue fox nor grey, neither cross
nor black? .&ensp;.&ensp;. Was it senility or debility or a splendid
freak in the animal world like a Newton or a Shakespeare
in the human race? Of all the scientists from
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
Royal Society and hall of learning, who came to gossip
over the sales at the coffee houses, not one could explain
the silver fox.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Adventurers’ right to the greater part of the
present Dominion of Canada was disputed by the
French. A nation went to war with a company.
France dispatched fighting fleets. So did the Adventurers;
for, what with the high price of silver fox and
the low price of beads, the iron box at Fenchurch Street
kept well filled. Hudson Bay was again and again the
scene of horrible carnage; now one party having the
best of it, now another. Anybody wishing to have his
eyes opened to what happened between 1682 and 1713
should read “The Conquest of the Great North West,”
by the authoress I have just quoted. Let us fix our
gaze on one typical scene in the grim retrospect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1697 five French men-of-war arrived in Hudson
Straits under the command of the redoubtable Iberville.
On his ship, the <span class='it'>Pelican</span>, forty men were down with
scurvy. On another, the <span class='it'>Wasp</span>, a gun broke loose
during a gale, crushing several of the crew. For
eighteen days the little fleet was ice-jammed in an
impenetrable fog. Later, the <span class='it'>Pelican</span> became separated
from the rest of the fleet. Seeing three ships on the
horizon, Iberville hastened towards the supposed
friends. They proved to be English men-of-war, the
<span class='it'>Hampshire</span>, the <span class='it'>Dering</span>, and the <span class='it'>Hudson’s Bay</span>. When
the French commander made that discovery, it was too
late to flee. “Quickly, ropes were stretched to give the
mariners hand-hold over the frost-slippery deck. Stoppers
were ripped from the fifty cannon, and the batterymen
below, under La Salle and Grandville, had stripped
naked in preparation for the hell of flame and heat that
was to be their portion in the impending battle.
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
Bienville, Iberville’s brother, swung the infantrymen in line
above decks, swords and pistols prepared for the hand-to-hand
grapple. De la Potherie got the Canadians
to the forecastle, knives and war hatchets out, bodies
stripped, all ready to board when the ships knocked
keels.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;. The <span class='it'>Hampshire</span> let fly two roaring cannonades
that ploughed up the decks of the <span class='it'>Pelican</span> and
stripped the French bare of masts to the hull. At the
same instant, Grimmington’s <span class='it'>Dering</span> and Smithsend’s
<span class='it'>Hudson’s Bay</span> circled to the left of the French and
poured a stream of musketry fire across the <span class='it'>Pelican’s</span>
stern. At one full blast, forty French were mowed
down; but the batterymen below never ceased their
crash of bombs straight into the <span class='it'>Hampshire’s</span> hull.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For four hours the battle raged. “The ships were
so close, shout and counter-shout could be heard across
decks. Faces were singed with the closeness of the
musketry fire. Ninety French had been wounded. The
<span class='it'>Pelican’s</span> decks swam in blood that froze to ice, slippery
as glass, and trickled down the clinker boards in reddening
splashes. Grape shot and grenade had set the
fallen sails on fire. Sails and mast poles and splintered
davits were a mass of roaring flame that would presently
extend to the powder magazines and blow all
to eternity.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;. Still the batterymen below poured their
storm of fire and bomb into the English hull. The
fighters were so close, one old record says, and the holes
torn by the bombs so large in the hull of each ship, that
the gunners on the <span class='it'>Pelican</span> were looking into the eyes
of the smoke-grimed men below the decks of the <span class='it'>Hampshire</span>.
For three hours the English had tacked to board
the <span class='it'>Pelican</span>, and for three hours the mastless, splintered
<span class='it'>Pelican</span> had fought like a demon to cripple her enemy’s
approach. The blood-grimed, half-naked men had
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
rushed <span class='it'>en masse</span> for the last leap, the hand-to-hand
fight, when a frantic shout went up.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;. The batteries
of the <span class='it'>Hampshire</span> had suddenly silenced. The great
ship refused to answer to the wheel. That persistent,
undeviating fire bursting from the sides of the <span class='it'>Pelican</span>
had done its work. The <span class='it'>Hampshire</span> gave a quick, back
lurch. Before the amazed Frenchmen could believe
their senses, amid the roar of flame and crashing billows
and hiss of fires extinguished in an angry sea, the
<span class='it'>Hampshire</span>, all sails set, settled and sank like a stone
amid the engulfing billows. Not a soul of her two
hundred and fifty men—one hundred and ninety
mariners and servants, with sixty soldiers—escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The screams of the struggling seamen had not
died on the waves before Iberville had turned the batteries
of his shattered ship full force on Smithsend’s
<span class='it'>Hudson’s Bay</span>. Promptly the <span class='it'>Hudson’s Bay</span> struck
colours, but while Iberville was engaged boarding his
captive and taking over ninety prisoners, Grimmington
on the <span class='it'>Dering</span> showed swift heel and gained refuge in
Fort Nelson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Iberville had not noticed the gathering storm, which
now broke upon him. “Mist and darkness and roaring
sleet drowned the death cries of the wounded, washed
and tossed and jammed against the railings by the
pounding seas. The <span class='it'>Pelican</span> could only drive through
the darkness before the storm flaw; ‘the dead,’ says an
old record, ‘floating about on the decks among the
living.’ The hawser that had towed the captive ship
snapped like thread. Captor and captive in vain threw
out anchors. The anchors raked bottom. Cables were
cut, and the two ships drove along the sands. The
deck of the <span class='it'>Pelican</span> was icy with blood. Every shock
of smashing billows jumbled dead and dying <span class='it'>en masse</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
The night grew black as pitch. The little railing that
still clung to the shattered decks of the <span class='it'>Pelican</span> was
now washed away, and the waves carried off dead and
wounded. Tables were hurled from the cabin. The
rudder was broken, and the water was already to the
bridge of the foundering ship, when the hull began to
split, and the <span class='it'>Pelican</span> buried her prow in the sands, six
miles from the fort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boats had been shot away. Men swam ashore
with guns and powder-horns between their teeth. They
also strove to tow rough rafts on which the wounded
were placed. Eighteen lives were lost in the darkness.
As for the survivors, “for twelve hours they had fought
without pause for food, and now, shivering round fires
kindled in the bush, the half-famished men devoured
moss and seaweed raw. Two feet of snow lay on the
ground, and when the men lighted fires and gathered
round them, they became targets for sharpshooters
from the fort, who aimed at the camp fires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then three of Iberville’s other ships arrived, one
without her steering gear, another without her rudder.
The <span class='it'>Violent</span> had foundered in a storm. A Frenchman
went with flag of truce and bandaged eyes to demand
surrender of the fort. Its English garrison sent him
back with “No” for his answer. Under cover of fog,
the French landed and erected their cannon in the very
teeth of the fort. A mutual bombardment occupied two
days. Then the French sent another emissary to explain
that, if the fort did not surrender, no quarter would be
given. “Quarter be cursed!” thundered Bailey, the
English commander. Afterwards the palisades were
hacked down; and when the inevitable capitulation took
place, the garrison marched out with flags flying, to
the defiant music of fife and drum.
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Truly, the French and English of those days were
game and tough, and not lacking in the more conspicuous
qualities of the tiger and the bulldog. For all
those ships and men to have been fighting over the
beaver and the silver fox, and the filling of that iron
box in Fenchurch Street, gives the modern mind a
good deal to think about. As one reads the story of
fierce international hatred, of incursions and pillage and
crafty ambuscades, of frequent battles on land and
water, Hudson Bay figures to the imagination as a
frozen inferno of bloodshed, famine, disease and human
anguish unspeakable. The rival traders and raiders
timed their death-grips as far as possible to correspond
with official periods of warfare between France and
Great Britain; but European compacts did not always
carry weight with the moving spirits of Hudson Bay.
However, the Peace of Utrecht left the company at
last in uncontested possession of that huge area, and
brought to a close the Adventurers’ long maritime
struggle. Their warlike operations, however, were not
over, for presently the company became involved in
sustained and sanguinary inland strife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the French King held sway in “New France,”
certain of its citizens, acting under Royal licence, adventured
into the forests to collect furs from the Indians.
Strangely enough, the extinction of French authority
in Eastern Canada gave a great impetus to that French
industry. Licences being no longer needed, an augmented
army of daring spirits went forth in canoes to
voyage into the unknown territories, and barter beads
and brandy for the red man’s furry booty. Merchants
at Montreal fitted out the dashing <span class='it'>voyageurs</span>, and waxed
opulent from the sale of skins. A fierce rivalry grew
among the enterprising Frenchmen, who strove to
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
out-vie one another in hospitality to the much-sought-after
Indians. There were incidents like this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>A party of drunken Crees became so obstreperous in
their demand for more rum that three traders, who had
a little fort as shelter, sought to strengthen their position
by adding laudanum to the liquor. One Indian
drank too much and died, whereupon his enraged followers
smashed the fort and slaughtered their three
treacherous hosts, as well as seven other men who happened
to be present. Nor did revenge stop there.
Word was sent to other tribes that all white traders
had better be massacred; and not far away, three companies
of Frenchmen, sleeping within the inadequate
protection of three wooden houses, were aroused one
night by the dread war cry of the Assiniboines, and,
for the most part, were promptly slain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the English fur traders were traversing
the rivers that flowed into Hudson Bay, and erecting
their fortified posts away inland. Just how far
“Rupert’s Land” extended in any given direction they
were not in a position to say—they merely knew that,
be it little or much, it all belonged to them; Charles
II., having, indeed, given away most of the North
American continent with true kingly generosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus it came about that the French fur traders,
besides having to put up with a rivalry among themselves,
and with spasmodic Indian savagery, found
themselves confronted by English competitors, who
looked upon them as trespassers and thieves. In the
circumstances, the Montreal merchants (who, to add to
the complication, were Scotsmen) judged it advisable to
combine, so that the <span class='it'>voyageurs</span> from Eastern Canada
should present a united front to their foes. Such was
the origin, in 1783, of the North-West Company,
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
destined to grow exceedingly rich and reckless and
to maintain a long, fierce and bloody feud with the
Hudson’s Bay Company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us glance at a few representative incidents
recorded by Agnes Laut: “The North-West partner,
Haldane, came to Bad Lake in 1806 with five <span class='it'>voyageurs</span>
and knocked up quarters for themselves near the Hudson’s
Bay cabins. By May, William Corrigal, the Hudson’s
Bay man, had four hundred and eighty packs
of furs. One night, when all the English were asleep,
the Nor’-West bullies marched across, broke into the
cabins, placed pistols at the heads of Corrigal and his
men, and plundered the place of furs.” There was
further trouble at the same place a little later. “An
Indian had come to the post in September. Corrigal
outfitted him with merchandise for the winter’s hunt,
and three English servants accompanied the <span class='it'>saulteur</span>
down to the shore. Out rushed the Nor’-Wester
MacDonell flourishing his sword, accompanied by a
bully, Adhemer, raging aloud that the Indian had
owed furs to the Nor’-Westers and should not be
allowed to hunt for the Hudson’s Bay. The two Corrigal
brothers and one Tait ran from the post to the
rescue. With one sweep of the sword, Eneas MacDonell
cut Tait’s wrist off, and with another hack on
the neck felled him to the ground. The French bully
had aimed a loaded pistol at the Corrigals, daring them
to take one step forward. John Corrigal dodged into
the lake. MacDonell then rushed at the Englishmen
like a madman, cutting off the arm of one, sending a
hat flying from another whose head he missed, hacking
the shoulder of a third. Unarmed, the Hudson’s Bay
men fled for the fort gates. The Nor’-Westers pursued.
Coming from the house door, John Mowat, a
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
Hudson’s Bay man, drew his pistol and shot Eneas
MacDonell dead. Couriers went flying to the North-West
camp for reinforcements. Haldane and McLellan,
two partners, came with a rowdy crew and threatened
if Mowat were not surrendered they would have the
Indians butcher every soul in the fort, if it cost a keg
of rum for every scalp. Mowat promptly surrendered,”
and, after being confined for a year at Fort William,
was sentenced by Montreal judges to be imprisoned
for six months and to be branded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The business rivals overran the whole country right
to the Pacific, and the names of rivers and passes in
Western Canada bear witness to the enterprise and
hardihood of those pioneer explorers. Indeed, the
Hudson’s Bay men and the Nor’-Westers discovered
between them the bulk of the Dominion. That is their
title to the respect and gratitude of posterity. For the
rest, what a tragic farce the whole business was! Here
was a country so enormous that the fastest trains to-day
occupy nearly a week in crossing it by a direct route
from east to west; a country stretching so far northward
that its present population of eight million merely
suffices thinly to sprinkle a southern strip; a country
with agricultural and mineral resources adequate for
the support of over one hundred million people—and
those two commercial corporations turned their opportunities
to no better account than in murdering one
another’s representatives over the miserable business of
trading beads and brandy for the hides of small quadrupeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Please do not suppose that I write in any spirit of
criticism and censure. The world evolves in its own
strange way; and the human race is permanently incapacitated
by altered circumstances from sitting in
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
judgment on its ancestors. Still, the spectacle of those
two companies feeling cramped by each other’s presence
in a roomy place like Canada, and using pistols
and daggers to lessen the pressure of commercial competition,
is exceedingly droll, if grim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The state of affairs to which I have referred continued
until 1821, when the Hudson’s Bay Company
absorbed its formidable opponent. That amalgamation
was preceded by a very interesting and important event.
Lord Selkirk, a wealthy viscount, and one of the noblest
characters in Canadian history, established the first community
of immigrant settlers in the North-West—a fact
to which I shall recall the reader’s attention in my
chapter about Winnipeg. The area conceded for
settlement was known as the Red River district, and
included much of the present Province of Manitoba
and part of what is now the State of Minnesota. To
secure the co-operation of the Hudson’s Bay Company
in his philanthropic design, Lord Selkirk had taken
the precaution first to buy up a controlling interest in
that commercial concern. Warfare between Nor’-Westers
and Hudson’s Bay men involved those early
settlers in some bloody horrors. But in the present
chapter we need only consider the affairs of the pioneer
community in relation to the future opening up of the
entire North-West to colonisation. And first I would
mention a peaceful understanding at which the Selkirk
settlers arrived with the Indians of the district. Land
was surrendered in consideration of the annual payment
to each tribe of “one hundred pounds of good merchantable
tobacco”; that compact of 1817 being interesting
as the forerunner of an important series of
treaties with the red man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>United as one company, the fur traders flourished
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
exceedingly, and came in time to exercise authority, not
merely throughout the present Dominion, but over
territory since absorbed into the American Republic,
besides extending their sway to Alaska and across the
ocean to the Sandwich Islands—a tolerably large area
to be exploited in the interests of the iron box of Fenchurch
Street. The coming of human settlers to disturb
the furry quadrupeds was, of course, a calamity to be
prevented, or at any rate delayed, by all the power
and statecraft at the company’s command. But the
tide of democracy could not for ever be resisted, and
the pelt-collectors’ title to a huge empire melted before
the hard facts of American, British and Russian
occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The company was not so foolish as to take up arms
in defence of its flimsy rights. Its policy was to hinder
human encroachment as long as possible, and then bow
to the inevitable. By 1835 its spheres of influence had
sadly dwindled, and its titles to territorial possession
were becoming more and more shadowy. The governor
and his committee perceived the necessity for doing
something to arrest the decay of their power and prestige.
So it was the strange fate of the Red River
colony to be bought back by the Hudson’s Bay Company,
for a sum of £84,000, from the heirs of Lord
Selkirk. In that colony the fur traders now established
an autocratic government that aimed primarily at the
vigorous suppression of all private trade in pelts. It
was not long before the settlers were gasping for
freedom. Vainly they demanded the representative
government that had been secured under the American
flag by their comrades in Minnesota. At the opening
of the second half of the nineteenth century, indeed,
the fate of the Red River settlement—the pioneer colony
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
of the West—hung in the balance. Would it, like
Oregon, join the Union? In that critical situation, an
independent element of unrest was provided by the
growing discontent of the Half-Breeds. For long years
past, the fur traders—and more particularly the French
Nor’-Westers—had intermarried with the Indians, and
brought into existence that numerous, pathetic people,
who inherited the conflicting traditions of two races.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of growing unrest in the Red River settlement,
the Home Government instituted a Parliamentary
inquiry into the affairs of the Hudson’s Bay Company.
That inquiry seemed to effect nothing. But, hey presto!
a change came over the position immediately afterwards.
In 1863 a syndicate of capitalists, known as the
International Financial Association, bought up the
Hudson’s Bay Company for £1,500,000, and turned
over the concern to new shareholders in a new Hudson’s
Bay Company on a footing of increased capital. The
tension was relieved; for public interests were represented
by a wisely-controlled force working in the
background. With the confederation in 1867 of Canada
East, Canada West, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,
the creation of the Dominion of Canada commenced.
The newly established Federal Government promptly
arrived at an understanding whereby the Hudson’s Bay
Company relinquished any rights of territorial administration
it may anywhere have possessed; and in 1870
the Red River colony became the Province of Manitoba
and an invaluable part of the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before suffering the Company to pass out of
this narrative, I must satisfy the reader’s curiosity concerning
the terms it secured. It received a money payment
of £300,000; it was granted one-twentieth of the
arable land in the country over which, at the date of
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
the arrangement, it held dominion; and its title to all
land on which its forts stood was confirmed. Probably
the shareholders have never regretted the bargain made
on their behalf. “How valuable one-twentieth of the
arable land was to prove,” says Agnes Laut, “the
company itself did not realise till recent days, and what
wealth it gained from the cession of land where its
forts stood may be guessed from the fact that at Fort
Garry (Winnipeg) this land comprises five hundred
acres of what are now city lots at metropolitan values.”
Moreover, I understand that the business of collecting
furs is still a lucrative one; while visitors to Canada
will not fail to notice, in all the great cities, the magnificent
general stores of the Hudson’s Bay Company.</p>

<p class='caption'>NEW UNION STATION, WINNIPEG</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>One regrettable fact has to be noted in connection
with the creation of the Province of Manitoba. The
anxious and bewildered Half-Breeds, fearing their
interests were in peril, rose in rebellion under Louis
Riel, the trouble not being repressed until Colonel
(afterwards Viscount) Wolseley crossed the continent
with an armed force. The growth of Manitoba under
representative government has been one of the most
inspiring achievements of modern times; but the history
of that province merges at this point into the history
of Western Canada, to which it had become the open
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Western Canada provided the Federal Government
with several problems, of which the most pressing concerned
the status of the roving bands of Indians. In
the States, civilisation was driving back the natives
with fire and sword. In Canada, recourse was had to
milder and more effective methods. But in one respect
the Yankees and the Canadians acted in concert. They
joined in a war of extermination against the buffalo.
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
Of the number of those animals roaming the prairie, it
is difficult for anybody nowadays to form a conception.
One traveller recorded that he rode for twenty-five miles
through an unbroken herd, which he estimated to include
one million animals. In the States, “Buffalo
Bill” (Colonel Cody) took an active part in the work
of extermination. He is credited with shooting forty-eight
of the poor creatures in fifty minutes. In a period
of some eighteen months—when he was under contract
to supply all the meat needed by the huge army of
men engaged in constructing the Kansas Pacific Railway—he
accounted for 4,280 buffaloes. On both sides
of the international boundary line, the country was
swept clean of these fine beasts. I have seen places
on the prairie white with an accumulation of their bones,
whereof the weathered relics may still be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Indians saw what was being done, they
were filled with apprehension. The buffalo was their
means of subsistence. Its flesh supplied them with
meat, both fresh and, when pounded down and mixed
with fat, as pemmican; its skin provided them with
clothing, tents, canoes, bridle and reins; its sinews
made strings for their bows; and its horns served them
as powder flasks. But the Federal Government had no
intention of permitting the Indians to starve. Their
helplessness without the buffalo was the means of bringing
them, willy-nilly, within the pale of civilisation. I
have mentioned the pioneer compact with the red man
achieved by the Selkirk settlers. That had been followed
by similar understandings in Eastern Canada.
And now the Federal Government effected a series of
treaties with the North-West Indians, who surrendered
any general claim they may have had to the country
at large, and accepted a specific title to ample lands, or
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
reserves, set apart for their exclusive use. Moreover,
the Government agreed to make them annual money
payments, and to grant them free rations until such
time as they should be self-supporting—an end Canada
is striving (and not without a very encouraging measure
of success) to further by providing the tribes with
schools, both general and agricultural, and with cattle,
seed, and farming implements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interests of the natives were served in another
way. American traders, in defiance of the law, were
supplying them with intoxicants; and the fascinating,
maddening “fire water” was a temptation wellnigh
irresistible to the red man. To sweep that traffic from
the prairie, the Government enrolled the North-West
Mounted Police—a force that has won for itself a splendid
reputation for tact, pluck and all-round efficiency.
The suppression of the illicit liquor trade was one of
the earliest and best of its achievements. The Riders
of the Plains won the respect and confidence of the
Indians, and carried through a treaty with the warlike
Blackfeet—the last tribes to be won from a footing of
irresponsible independence. When the Half-Breeds,
again under Louis Riel, once more raised the flag of
revolt, the mounted police rendered effective assistance
in repressing the trouble; and this time it was repressed
permanently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The year of that rebellion witnessed the completion
of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the creation of
modern Western Canada.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span><h1 id='t1370'>CHAPTER III<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>QUEBEC PROVINCE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most interesting facts concerning Canada
is that very little is known about it. Its eight million
people are scattered along the southern strip—a mere
fraction of the country. The great bulk of Canada is
neither settled nor surveyed. Nay, it has not been
explored, save in the sense that a person proceeding
along the road from London to Scotland may be said
to have explored England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Settlement in Western Canada is necessarily of recent
date. But in Eastern Canada civilisation has already
had a good innings. The colonising of Quebec
province began three hundred years ago. Therefore
a hasty thinker would be apt to suppose that, however
much uncertainty may envelop other parts of the
Dominion, Quebec province must by this time be well-trodden
territory. What smiles that supposition would
cause among the urbane politicians and officials I met
in the provincial Parliament House!</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the population of Canada, instead of being eight
millions, were one hundred and ten millions—that is,
an equivalent to the German and French nations rolled
into one—and if the whole of that population were
concentrated in Quebec province, the inference of the
hasty thinker would probably be correct. For the area
of Quebec province is nearly equal to France and
Germany combined.
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span></p>

<p class='caption'>QUEBEC FROM THE ST. LAWRENCE: WINTER SCENE</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>How can a couple of million busy people inspect
and investigate, let alone settle and develop, such an
area? Necessarily they and their homes, their farms,
their factories, and their railways occupy but a fraction
of their vast territory. All the rest of the country
is available to whomsoever cares to go and unlock its
riches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time was when the French-Canadians gave little
attention to the problems and possibilities presented
by the unknown geography with which they were
associated. Prosperous, healthy, and happy, they were
satisfied to let the land north of 48° latitude and west
of 70° longitude look after itself. But nowadays settled
Quebec is much interested in unsettled Quebec. I will
tell you why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canada, having a pre-vision of her destiny, is
vigorously engaged in promoting it. She has set herself
the task of attracting population by proclaiming
her resources. The paramount need has become the
ruling interest. In travelling through the country, you
will find that matter uppermost in the mind of every
adult with whom you converse. And it is recognised
as a leading concern of the State. The Federal Government
and the Provincial Governments are expending
much thought, ingenuity, and money in furthering this
national policy of promoting immigration. The collecting
of facts, with a view to their publication, is recognised
as one important means to that end. Therefore
the Governments are constantly sending prospecting
scientists into the unknown lands to scratch the face of
Nature and gain some clues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give an idea of Quebec province, I will briefly
outline a journey made in 1905 by Mr. A. P. Low (now
Deputy Minister of Mines) into the Chibougamau
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
district. It is by no means remote, being not much
more than a hundred miles from a railway. How Mr.
Low came to be sent there was because certain prominent
citizens of Quebec, having received interesting
tidings from the Chibougamau district, suggested to
Sir Wilfrid Laurier that a member of the Geological
Survey ought to go and have a look at it. The interesting
tidings are worth recalling, since they illustrate
the sort of treatment pioneers receive at the hands of
Fate. It appears that Mr. Peter McKenzie made a
“prospecting and trading journey” through the region
in 1903, and while this enterprising gentleman was
looking for iron ores “he chanced upon an important
discovery of asbestos” (I quote from a Government
record, save that I decline to spell the infusible fibrous
mineral with a “u”). Thus encouraged, Mr. McKenzie
re-visited the district in the following year, and this
time he searched for copper deposits, and found “a
large mass of gold-bearing quartz.” Had he gone yet
a third time, and tried to locate a tin mine, he would,
I presume, have stumbled upon a reef of diamonds;
but that is mere conjecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now for Mr. Low’s experiences. Leaving Ottawa
on June 21st, he went by rail to Lake St. John, and
there secured the services of eight Indians, four (who
knew the Chibougamau district as well as I know
Charing Cross) being engaged to act as canoemen,
the other four being required merely to assist with the
baggage on the outward journey. And here let me
point out what a useful rôle, in connection with the
development of Canada, is served by the red man, now
that he has been tamed and completely cured of his
old abominable practice of removing people’s scalps.
To the prospector and the surveyor the Indians are
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
invaluable pilots and porters, their navigation of swift
currents being marked by a skill to which the average
white man is a stranger. Sustained toil is not to their
liking, since it is inconsistent with that large measure
of leisure and meditation which they associate with
human existence; but, for the rest, Canada’s pioneers
and explorers give them a good name. One distinguished
surveyor, who has had much experience in
the wilds, told me he could recall only a single instance
of dishonesty on the part of an Indian who had served
him; nor, when he detailed the affair, could I shut my
eyes to an element of justification in the delinquent’s
conduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I arranged with the Indian,” said the surveyor,
“that, for an agreed sum, he should pilot me along a
dangerous stretch of river to a portage where I proposed
to camp for the night. He did so, and I paid him his
money; but you may imagine my annoyance when,
on returning to the river-side after half an hour’s stroll
in the woods, I found that the ruffian had absconded
with a pair of my blankets. Such an unusual occurrence
rankled in my memory, and four months later,
on the return journey, I made it my business to inquire
for that Indian. It turned out that he was still in the
district, and when I charged him with the theft he
calmly admitted it. But it was right, he contended,
that he should take my blankets, and he went on to tell
me why. Nine years previously, a white man engaged
him as guide, and afterwards slipped off without paying
the promised fee. It was a mean thing to do, and
a most unwise one, because the Indian has a very
tenacious memory for anything in the nature of
treachery. For nine years, you see, this Ojibway had
nursed his wrong, and from the next white man who
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
came along he exacted retribution. From my point of
view this was rather crude justice, and at first I requested
the return of my property. But I did not press the
point when I saw how incapable he was of grasping
the subtlety that white men are not answerable for one
another’s sins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before railways were invented, and when the whole
world depended on roads and rivers, it must have been
hard to say where settlement ended and the wilderness
began. But to-day civilisation marks its domain by
steel lines, and a territory that lacks railways is unable
to compete, whether in agriculture, mining, or manufactures,
with territories that possess railways. Mr.
Low’s experiences—which are the experiences of
Canada’s hundred and one other explorers—reintroduce
us to the world as it existed before Watt and Stephenson
interfered. No road having been made to the Chibougamau
district, he had to fall back on the rivers. And
with rivers, be it noted, Nature has liberally endowed
Quebec province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having laid in a good stock of provisions, Mr.
Low secured some stout cedar canoes, and set off on
his journey from Lake St. John—he and the Indians.
They did not advance with the speed which readers of
Fenimore Cooper’s novels would expect. Their rate
of progress averaged fifteen miles a day, the responsibility
for this dilatoriness lying wholly with the Ashwapmuchuan
River. Only every now and then is it a
level, composed, and Thames-like avenue of water.
In between whiles, after the wont of Canadian rivers,
it plays leap-frog down the gradients. On approaching
foaming rapids and roaring cascades, Mr. Low and the
Indians got out and walked. Carrying canoes, stores,
and baggage over portages that are sometimes a mile
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
in length is, of course, a laborious and slow business.
On the other hand, it is better to go through with that
ordeal than to be whirled over a waterfall that has a
sheer drop of sixty feet—to mention one picturesque
feature occurring along Mr. Low’s route.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will not dilate upon the glorious mountains and
the verdant valleys that came under the explorer’s
notice. The lovely lakes—some of them twenty miles
and more in length—rather tried his patience. “Many
of them are so indented and dotted with islands,” he
deplored, “that it is difficult for even the Indian guides
to follow correctly the channels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He noted the millions of dormant dollars existing
in the form of timber: the black spruce (most abundant
of all), the fir, the banksian pine, the aspen and balsam
poplars, the white birch, the cedar, and other useful
sorts. “White spruce up to twenty-four inches in
diameter are,” he reported, “in many places numerous
enough to permit of profitable lumbering if any means
existed for transport to the southern markets.” But
discerning science did not confine itself to indicating
the fortunes in forests that awaited human immigrants.
It shed a passing tear over the timber wealth that had
been already consumed by immigrants of another genus.
“Larch formerly grew in abundance,” Mr. Low reported,
“and often they exceeded the white spruce in
size,” as was obvious from old trees still standing as
skeletons. But about twelve years ago, it seems, those
forests were destroyed by a visitation of the European
larch saw-fly—that wasp without a waist whose caterpillars
have a large appetite, twenty legs, and an interesting
way of standing with the hind part of their
bodies gracefully curled over their heads. So our
European saw-fly was the guilty party, was he? One
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
wonders how in the name of Christopher Columbus he
got across.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Low found some white fellow-creatures in the
virgin territory he was exploring. To begin with, he
saw (as the opening of this narrative will have prepared
my readers to learn) a small party of miners working
at the asbestos outcrops on Asbestos Island in McKenzie
Bay, which is situated in the north-west corner of
Chibougamau Lake. He also found in the district other
white, or whitish, people, who were residents of long
standing. Indeed, the strange fact has to be noted that
groups of these white or whitish people are to be found
in even the most northerly and remote districts of unexplored
and unexploited Canada. The history of the
Hudson’s Bay Company—one of the greatest dramas
that the world and the centuries have witnessed—was
sufficiently outlined in the preceding chapter. In this
place it is merely necessary to relate that, on
approaching Lake Mistassini, Mr. Low found “a
number of old men, women and children” congregated
on the shore, awaiting the arrival of some flour and
groceries they were expecting by canoe from Hudson
Bay. Much earlier in his travels, at a point only some
sixty miles from Lake St. John, he had come upon
another settlement of the ancient fur-collecting corporation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a manner wholly unforeseen, the Hudson’s Bay
Company is proving of great value to modern Canada.
Each of its outposts of civilisation is a treasury of clues
to the agricultural possibilities of an unknown country.
The trappers, in their remote isolation, have naturally
gone in for a little gardening. It has helped to pass
the time, not to mention the advantage of having fresh
vegetables and ripe gooseberries on the dinner-table.
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
When the rare visitor now arrives, as an emissary from
populated regions away in the south, the Hudson Bay
folk must be intensely gratified by the interest he takes
in their cultivated back-yards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Low is not the man to neglect opportunities.
“The surrounding country appears to be fertile,” he
noted, “as, in the clearing about the old Hudson’s Bay
Company post, timothy grass grows abundantly and
small fruits ripen early.” On the other hand, no great
success had apparently attended horticultural efforts at
the second trappers’ settlement he visited. “Great
difficulty is experienced,” we are told, “in growing a
small crop of potatoes, although the soil is the best in
the region.” Again, “attempts have been made at this
place to grow oats, barley, and wheat, but without
success.” The explanation of this unsatisfactory state
of things is detected by the scientific mind, and a
valuable hint to the agricultural world is the result.
This particular Hudson’s Bay post happens to be twelve
hundred feet above sea-level—indeed, it occurs very
near the line of greatest elevation running through
Quebec province. “When lands are situated above the
thousand-foot level,” Mr. Low points out, “there is
constant danger of summer frosts, though these would
probably be lessened by clearing the lands and breaking
the surface with the plough.” He emphasises his contention
by instancing experiences at the Hudson’s Bay
post beside Waswanipi Lake, which is situated about
one hundred and fifty miles away to the south-west.
The climatic conditions are more favourable there
because the elevation is only seven hundred feet above
sea-level. At the Waswanipi station, we learn, “excellent
root crops are grown annually, while experiments
with the cultivation of cereals show that oats, barley,
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
and the hardier varieties of wheat easily ripen.” The
Canadian settler, when choosing a northern homestead,
will be well advised to keep this matter of elevation
in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Low, it will be observed, by no means limits
his investigations, when travelling through a new
country, to matters germane to his own science. “The
fisheries of the larger lakes,” reported this broad-minded
geologist, “will undoubtedly be a source of considerable
wealth to the province as soon as a railway provides
quick transport.” Speaking from personal experience,
he goes on to say that “the chief food fishes are lake-trout,
brook-trout, pike, pickerel, sturgeon, whitefish,
and two species of sucker.” The sucker is, I believe,
also known on the North American continent as the
“stone-roller” and the “red-horse.” No doubt it is
more appetising than it sounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming now to matters belonging to Mr. Low’s
special province, I must first mention his discovery of
an interesting freak of Nature. “Near the western end
of McKenzie Bay,” it seems, “is a low cone of dark,
rotten serpentine, peculiar on account of its magnetic
attraction, the compass pointing to it from all directions
within a radius of half a mile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A geological report is, of course, a solemn, technical,
and unsensational document. The business of a geologist
is to identify the rocks, seen and unseen, the word
“rocks,” in its scientific application, including pretty
well every constituent of the globe save water and air.
The geologist does not mine for gold, silver, and
precious stones; he merely decides whether and where
it would be worth while to mine for them. His task
is to go in advance and prepare the way for the
prospector.
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Mr. Low’s report does little more than hint
at mineral wealth. Having confirmed the discovery of
a large mass of gold-bearing quartz, he states the conditions
under which similar bodies may perhaps be
found in neighbouring localities. As to copper, we
have to be content with the information that “in a
number of places good signs of ore are seen in diabase
schists.” Concerning iron, a “locality of promise” is
indicated. With regard to asbestos, which lends itself
to readier identification, we have more definite information.
“All the areas of serpentine discovered in the
region up to the present time,” Mr. Low’s report bears
witness, “contain veins of asbestos, and in many places
these veins are of sufficient size and number to form
valuable deposits as soon as a railway is built to the
shores of Chibougamau Lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Low made the return journey in fine style,
“shooting all the rapids along the river,” and arriving
at Lake St. John on September 1st. Thus his explorations
occupied more than nine weeks, and—rendering
testimony on yet another important point—he mentions
a sustained experience of fine weather, “not a day
having been lost by rain or head-winds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus by following in the footsteps of a scientific
scout of civilisation, we have had a peep at one morsel
of a huge territory which man has scarcely begun to
utilise. There are no means of measuring its natural
resources; we know only that they are vast. Conjecture
may, however, be based on analogy. The present population
of Quebec is practically restricted to a tenth part
of the province. What is being done in that tenth part
does not by any means represent finality, since development
in many districts is still at an early stage. Nevertheless,
the achievements of a part supply a clue to the
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
possibilities of the whole, so I will mention a few
instructive facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Last year some fifty million bushels of oats were
grown in the province of Quebec; and since to most
persons 50,000,000 is an indefinite total, and only
vaguely impressive, like 5,000,000 or 500,000,000, I may
mention, for the purpose of affording the reader a
standard of comparison, that in 1909 the quantity of
that grain grown in Scotland—the national head-quarters
of oat-cakes and porridge—was only thirty-eight
million bushels. Let me quote another item from
the long list of products yielded by the fraction of
Quebec province that is at present under cultivation.
The French-Canadians and their neighbours annually
grow about seventeen million bushels of potatoes, or
enough to supply the entire population of Ireland from
one year’s end to another, allowing for a consumption
of 2½ lbs. per week for every man, woman and child.
They also grow enough tobacco (principally black and
strong kinds, but including a good deal of Havana) to
meet the annual requirements of over a million moderate
smokers; while Quebec’s immense quantities of apples,
cheese, cherries, butter, pears, pumpkins and melons
also provide the statistician with much food for thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, while I am about it, let me give a hint or two
with reference to the present mineral output of the
province. Note, then, that in 1909 some three thousand
miners received £270,000 as wages for wresting
£459,000 worth of asbestos from the serpentine rocks
of Quebec—a region which in the same year enriched
the world with over a million barrels of Portland cement
(representing a value of £263,000), besides noteworthy
quantities of copper, graphite, marble, granite, phosphate,
mica, chromite, and ochres.
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span></p>

<p class='caption'>TOBACCO GROWING, QUEBEC PROVINCE</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>As to the forests, they represent a vast treasury
from which the lumber and pulp industries draw
annually a value of about £4,000,000; nor should we
forget the six thousand tons of luscious syrup tapped
from the maple trees. Again, there is not an area of the
earth more richly endowed with water-power; and therefore
to Quebec’s manufacturing activity, which has had
a brilliant beginning, no man can foresee the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those of my readers who are well-read sportsmen
will have been wondering why, all this time, I have
omitted to mention a supreme attraction of the region
under notice. With its vast virgin forests full of game,
its thousands of lakes and rivers alive with fish, Quebec
has won the title, in Canada and the United States, of
the Angler’s and Sportsman’s Paradise. Many a
wealthy American whiles away delightful months hunting
the caribou, moose and red deer, the beaver, mink
and yellow fox, the woodcock, partridge and widgeon,
in that beautiful country of the St. Lawrence River and
the Laurentian Range. American angling clubs lease
Quebec’s famous salmon pools, and hundreds of New
York’s busy citizens spend their holidays capturing the
monster trout, bass, pike, and whitefish for which the
province is famous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And anybody may acquire the freehold of one
hundred acres of that favoured country on paying
16s. 6d., with four following annual payments of the
same amount, the price of Crown land being 10d. per
acre, rising to 2s. 6d. in certain areas. For the rest,
steamers ply on some of the lakes, the Government is
rapidly extending its network of colonisation roads,
and in one district free railway transport is conceded
to arriving settlers and their families, with 300 lbs. of
household effects.
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor do these facilities exhaust the measures taken
by the provincial authorities to secure population. They
recognise a necessity to make further special effort in
view of a notable disadvantage in the matter of immigration
that is peculiar to Quebec. The majority of new
arrivals from the United Kingdom—little dreaming
what charming and helpful neighbours the French-Canadians
make—elect to locate themselves in the
provinces where their mother-tongue prevails, and, the
number of immigrants from France being insufficient
to adjust the balance, Quebec has its grievance. Perhaps
I ought rather to say that Quebec had its grievance,
for the genius of French-Canadian politicians has
proved a match for the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A law was passed granting boons and honour to
the mothers and fathers who rear twelve children or
more. I first heard of this stroke of enlightened statesmanship
when discussing Canada’s future with M.
E. E. Taché, the Deputy Minister of Lands and Forests
in Quebec’s noble Parliament House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not get our due proportion of the inrush of
settlers,” explained M. Taché. “Very well, then, for
peopling our vast province we look rather to the
natural increase of the population already here;” and
he presented me with a copy of Volume II. of an interesting
Government publication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This publication shows the law of the twelve children
in working. It seems that during the first fourteen
years of the existence of the statute 3,395 heads of
families were registered as qualified to receive the free
grant of 100 acres (or, in the alternative, fifty dollars)
by which a progressive Government recognised the
service they had rendered to Canada by rearing large
families. Those 3,395 names had been printed in
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
Volume I., and the significant fact has to be added that,
in the comparatively short ensuing period of fifteen
months, as many as 2,018 heads of families were added
to the roll of honour.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/img-044.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0012' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>TYPICAL FRENCH-CANADIAN FAMILY: SIXTEEN CHILDREN</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Those prize-winners are recorded in page after page
of a table printed in six columns. The first column
gives the name of the head of the family—usually, of
course, the father, but occasionally his widow or his
eldest son. Then occurs the name of the wife, or, in
the case of a second marriage, of the wives. The third
and fourth subdivisions indicate the parish and county
of residence. From the fifth column we learn how many
children there are in the family, and the sixth column
reveals whether the hundred acres or the fifty dollars
were preferred. Since the grant of land is associated
with an obligation to clear and cultivate it, and since
the people of Quebec are already provided with ample
farms, it is natural that choice alighted, in a majority
of cases, on the money payment. Here and there,
indeed, the table reveals a large family so wealthy and
contented that they have waived their claim alike to
the land and the cash. The proud father accepts as a
sufficient reward the honourable publicity conferred by
having his name conspicuously printed in State
archives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The column devoted to “<span class='it'>Nombre d’enfants</span>” repays
examination. The repetition of the number 12 is constantly
interrupted by 13, and, less frequently, by 14;
but you do not have to turn many pages before you
come upon a 15, then other 15’s, with a sprinkling of
16’s, and with even a 17 here and there. When, on
page sixty, I found evidence that a French-Canadian
of Montmorency had 18 children I did not doubt that
here, at last, I had reached high-water mark. Yet no;
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
on turning to page 127 I learnt that M. Cajetan
Vezina, of Hebertville, in the county of Lac St.
Jean, had 19 children. Among the 2,018 entries that
proved to be the top score. <span class='it'>Vive Québec! Vive la

<p class='pindent'>At night I stood upon a steel suspension bridge that
hung high above the mighty river it spanned. Electric
lamps shed light even down to the water, visible as
streaks of foam moving in the eddies. A deep bass
drummed unceasing in the ear, and I knew this muffled
thunder came out of the great ghostly cloud lying in
the darkness away up stream. The deep bass was a
background of sound for the treble of crickets piping
on the precipitous banks, black with dense vegetation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crossing the bridge, you enter the light and bustle
of an American city, with its stores and saloons and
hotels, its girls without hats and its men without waistcoats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, in cosy quarters on the Canadian side,
I was lulled to sleep by the subdued, dull roar, which
next morning greeted my awakening. From the hotel
window I had my first glimpse of Niagara Falls—of
a section, rather, for an outhouse obstructed the view.
I saw a wall of water glistening in the sunlight—green
transparency the upper part, opaque whiteness the
lower, with a cloud of rolling vapour at the base. From
a balcony I saw all—the straight American falls on
the left, the recessed Canadian falls on the right, and
the intervening island. At that distance Niagara Falls
are peaceful and beautiful. Leisurely the water curves
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
from the top in flashing emerald; slowly and softly it
descends in thick, broken, snowy coils; indolently it
evaporates at the bottom into pale fog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American portion seems small beside the far
sweep of the Canadian. Look curiously and you will
see one thin thread of water detached from the main
body of the American falls. During the afternoon I
was one of a party of friends on the island, close to
the top of that thread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entering a house divided into dressing-rooms, we,
under instruction, exchanged the whole of our own attire
for strange, picturesque costumes—enormous boots of
felt tied to the feet with string, blue woollen knickerbockers,
a blue woollen jacket, and an oilskin hat that
covered the ears. Others of the party accepted outer
suits of oilskins, so that they looked like fishermen in
northern latitudes equipped for a hurricane. It was a
hot afternoon, and I declined to be burdened with
those waterproof additions. “Oh, very well,” said the
attendant with composure; and he went on munching
his chewing-gum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out in the roadway we stood in a group to be photographed.
Two carriages came to a standstill in our
proximity, and the ladies within them laughed, and
laughed yet again, as they gazed upon us. Beginning
to descend a flight of wooden steps, we met an old
man coming up, an old man who, arrayed like my
companions in oilskins, looked to have had a recent
narrow escape from drowning. Wet and glistening,
he walked with bent back and heavy footsteps, a
saturated moustache assisting his melancholy aspect.
He was, it seemed, to be our guide, and soon we were
following him down the staircase, which was spiral, and
contained within a wooden tower.
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At the bottom, thunder stunned our ears, and only
by signals and grimaces could we communicate one
with another. The thunder never ceased as we followed
a downward path cut in the rugged cliff. Presently,
at a bend in the path, we saw a frightening sight. I
felt like a helpless insect watching the disruption of the
universe. The bottom of that thread of Niagara Falls
was immediately before us, edge on. Oh, the weight
and speed of the endless world of waters smashing
down upon the huge boulders! I strove to look upwards
to the full height of that grey cataclysm; but
the spray was blinding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following our guide to the right, we soon were
upon a rustic bridge spanning rocks washed by a
running riot of waves. The fine rain became a deluge
of great spots of heavy water, which hurt my shoulders
like pellets of lead. Bitterly did I regret my refusal
of the oilskins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we were in front of the waterfall, gasping,
with bowed heads, clutching by both hands at wooden
rails draped with slimy weed, and shuffling shamelessly
along the deluged planks. So we made our way over
several bridges—shuddering, blinded, deafened; and
as we crept up wooden stairs—a pitiful procession of
bent, helpless, suffering men—I found myself doubting
the wisdom of making this excursion when so high a
wind was blowing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow we gained a footing on another bridge,
and when I forced open my eyes it was to find ourselves
between a cliff of rock and a cliff of water. Still
were we bombarded by violent rain; still did thunder
numb our brains; still was my poor body pierced with
cold. But chiefly were our senses afflicted by the wind.
In that awful cloister the atmosphere seemed thin and
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
insufficient, and to be moving so quickly as to leave
us no time to breathe it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My right arm was clutched by the man ahead.
Instinctively I gripped the man behind. And so we
dragged one another through several moments of amazement,
blindness, and repressed fear—suddenly to
emerge, with a chorus of laughter, into dry, still, sunny
air. For there was no rain that day, and no wind—brilliant
sunshine pouring from the blue American sky.
The only thunder was caused by water falling 167 feet
on rugged rock in unending millions of tons. We had
passed round the base of the thin, detached thread of
the American falls. We had visited the Cave of the
Winds. I should not like to take that heroic shower-bath
every morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we reascended the pathway to the tower—dripping,
aglow, delighted—we turned our heads, and
beheld an unbroken rainbow shining in the clouds of
vapour that rolled across the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of that is but one experience of Niagara. Afterwards
we went on board the <span class='it'>Maid of the Mist</span>, where
special clothing was once more proferred us; and this
time I dressed in accordance with suggestion. On the
little steamer’s deck we soon were seated, cowled and
habited like a company of friars, with only our faces
showing. The stout little craft crept cautiously towards
the cataract. Soon we were cruising through the clouds
and into the white confusion of eddies, our craft riding
perceptibly deeper in water of a buoyancy reduced by
myriad intermingled bubbles of air. From the <span class='it'>Maid
of the Mist</span> we saw the might and majesty of the Niagara
Falls from a fresh, if somewhat hazy, point of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Niagara is certainly a most unsuitable place for a
river. First, there is that appalling, unavoidable tumble
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
down a precipice; then, when equilibrium and composure
have been recovered, and dignified progress is
resumed between verdant cliffs clothed with flowers and
innocence, more geographical treachery is met with.
Out of the left bank a bay has been scooped, and
water entering there is doomed to rush round and
round, entrapped and helpless, carrying branches,
leaves, and other floating objects in a monotony of
aimless circles. This is the whirlpool, and residents of
the neighbourhood tell you grim stories of men in
canoes, women in barrels, and derelict human corpses
travelling for weary hours in those dizzy waters, until
some chance eddy at last brought them within reach of
rescuing arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still lower down, the river knows the grievous disadvantage
of a channel inadequate to its bulk. Forsaking
their parallel relation, the banks deflect in
gradually converging lines. At once the water takes
alarm. Its face puckers into wrinkles of distress, then
is bedabbled with foam; and anon the panic-river,
blanched with terror, flings itself forward in delirious
haste, white wave climbing over white wave until, at
the point of greatest restriction, one sees high piles
of struggling water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between the whirlpool and the rapids I noted
strong men on the rocky banks fishing with thick rods
in the fierce current. Out on the Queenston heights
locusts droned in the trees on the battlefield, and wild
grapes were growing on slopes that commanded a far
view of fair scenery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have concluded my cursory sketch of Canada’s
greatest coal mine—white-coal mine. For a remarkable
change has come over the character of Niagara Falls.
In my school-days it was merely one of the wonders
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
of the world, and of no more practical account than the
Sphinx. Now it is a thing of infinite utility, and has
as definite a commercial value as the bullion in the
Bank of England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the history of mankind no fact is more quaint,
I think, than that the greatest achievements of civilisation
should be dependent, almost entirely, upon the
carboniferous strata in the crust of the earth. Coal, as
a means of producing steam, has long been the vital,
indispensable factor in human affairs. What would
become of the world, people have anxiously asked, when
our stock of the grimy mineral should be exhausted?
Nay, against that evil day we have long been eagerly
awaiting the discovery of an alternative source of heat,
the automobile almost suggesting that man has at last
put his finger on the substitute. Coal’s great rival has
been found; but it is not oil. It happens to be (and
this is another quaint fact in the history of mankind)
the waterfall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who would have thought it? Who could have
dreamed that water would prove the substitute—the
superior substitute—for fire? It was so natural to
suppose that coal could only be deposed by something
that was, at any rate, inflammable. We failed to remember
that steam and the piston-rod are but means
to an end; that end being—power. In the waterfall
we find power ready-made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To convert mechanical energy into the electric
current and utilise that current for practical purposes
of illumination, was a great achievement, now more than
thirty years old. To convert mechanical energy into
the electric current, dispatch that current to a distant
point, and there re-convert it, without serious leakage,
into mechanical energy, was a far greater achievement,
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
now about fifteen years old. Just exactly how it all
happens I will not attempt to explain, there being many
things concerning electricity that are not known to
science, as well as many things that are known to
science but not to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In visiting the power-houses at Niagara I went
behind the scenes, so to speak, and saw everything.
Also I saw nothing—energy being invisible. A power-house
is a shining palace of repose and polished
machinery. Each gallery of dynamos is a cloister of
peace, where a poet might compose verses to his lady’s
eyes. Huge turbines hum softly in the trim wheel-pit—so
deep, so quiet. The giant generator slumbers in
a death-like stillness only to be attained by machinery
revolving at the pace of twenty-six miles a second. At
Niagara one stands in the clean presence of a volume
of power measurable by the united strength of a million
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>White coal gives forth no smoke, dirt, or smell—which
reminds me of an instructive personal experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was at Hamilton, a city of between seventy and
eighty thousand inhabitants, and situated amid delightful
scenery at the western end of Lake Ontario. With
its hills and magnificent views, Hamilton suggests a
small Edinburgh, and (because of its tree-planted
avenues and public gardens) an Edinburgh built on
Garden-City lines. The train had lately taken me
through the orchards and vineyards of the Niagara
Peninsula, and here, in the market-place of Hamilton,
I found glowing produce from that region—tons of
peaches (selling for a few cents the large basketful),
and great consignments of apples, pears, plums, and
other fruits, massed with pyramids of vegetables and
glorious clusters of flowers, so that, in passing along
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
the bustling avenues, I walked amid the most seductive
perfumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This, then, is the Fruit City?” I suggested to the
resident of Hamilton who accompanied me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a new name,” he replied, “for the Birmingham
of Canada.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this I could not help laughing as I looked around
at Hamilton, a city bathed in unpolluted sunshine and
almost innocent of factory chimneys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Birmingham,” I pointed out, “is a manufacturing
centre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” said my companion; and he went on to
tell me of Hamilton’s four hundred large factories,
which annually produce I don’t know how many
million dollars’ worth of cotton goods, farm implements,
boots, furniture, and goodness knows what.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still was I mystified when dinner-bells rang in the
part of the city whither we had wandered, and from
out great buildings there poured swarms of high-spirited
toilers, who mounted their thousands of bicycles
and swept hungrily over the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I began to understand. The machinery in those
factories was worked by the water plunging down the
Niagara escarpment, over forty miles away. This was a
sunny, white-coal Birmingham. I prefer it to the
smoky, black-coal Birmingham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I first crossed the Atlantic, some nine years
ago, the Americans were deriving light and power from
Niagara, but the Canadians had merely begun preparations
to that end, preparations which, by the way, provided
a touch of romance. For a temporary breakwater
had been constructed some distance above the Falls,
thus laying bare a strip of the river bed, and on that
area of polished rock, which during countless ages had
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
been swept by a terrific force, little toddling children
were engaged in innocent frolics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Driving last year amid smiling homesteads, I saw
the great steel cable which, suspended from a succession
of lofty metal towers, transmits the power of the falls to
municipalities of Western Ontario, a share even going
to Toronto, which is more than eighty miles from the
famous cataract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The palatial power-houses, the illuminated cities,
the smokeless factories, the superb systems of electric
tramways—all combine to make a strong appeal to the
imagination. Yet Niagara, with its yield of 400,000
horse-power, is but a sample of the Dominion’s unnumbered
sources of force. Note this portentous fact—Canada’s
supply of white-coal, which is fifty per cent.
cheaper than black coal, greatly exceeds that of any
other country. In Ontario, prospectors have surveyed
readily-available sources to the extent of 3,500,000
horse-power. Some idea of British Columbia’s wealth
of waterfalls is conveyed to everyone who travels
through that glorious region. Quebec measures its
available horse-power by tens of millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When all the coal on the earth shall have been
consumed by our machines,” said M. Fabrèques, an
eminent French engineer, “Canada will be mistress of
the world.” At the time those words were written,
water-power and fire-power stood, or were supposed to
stand, on an economic equality. The superiority of
white-coal has since been demonstrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus to the future expansion of Canada’s manufactures,
who so rash as to prophesy a limit?</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span><h1 id='t2269'>CHAPTER V<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE LUMBER KING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Newly arrived in Ottawa one afternoon last summer,
I was standing amid its noble buildings, chatting with
a fat policeman; and the fat policeman, having identified
me as a visitor from England, said I must certainly
call on his friend J. R. Booth. My comment was
directed to the necessity for an introduction and an
appointment, whereupon a puzzled face revealed the
friendly constable as wondering what I was talking
about. Thus this incident epitomised the great difference
between two peoples, otherwise identical, who are
divided by three thousand miles of ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am British, and, consequently, a snob; the fat
policeman was Canadian, and, therefore, unhampered
by any sense of social distinctions. It would never
occur to a fat policeman in the Old Country that he
was everybody’s equal. If he happened to know a
millionaire, he would talk of that person with awe,
instead of with affectionate respect, as was the note
sounded in my corpulent companion’s references to
J. R. Booth. The untravelled English reader may find
a difficulty in realising that it is not a natural law,
by Providence ordained, which divides humanity into
ladies and gentlemen on the one hand, and common
people on the other. In this dear old country many
excellent folk would be shocked at the idea of dining
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
at the same table, or praying in the same pew, with
a man who does useful manual work; but the people
of Canada, while very much alive to the power of the
dollar, are blind and deaf to the idea that personal
wealth has anything to do with personal worth. The
fact is that kid gloves and the silk hat are emblematical
of a country that has reached a ripe, not to say rotten,
stage of development. In a new and progressive
country like Canada muscle commands, not emolument
alone, but honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the terrace of the Ottawa Parliament House—that
majestic Gothic pile which crowns the architectural
beauty of the capital—I looked out upon a far
sweep of beautiful Canadian scenery. Down below,
in the foreground of that living panorama, the eye
noted, on the farther shore of the broad stretch of
glistening river, a little town of workshops and factories
clustering behind the white smudge that marked a
waterfall. I was looking at the head-quarters of the
industry out of which the city of Ottawa has grown.
I was looking at the largest lumber-mill in the world.
I was looking at a part of the property created, owned,
and controlled by J. R. Booth, the friend of the fat
policeman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During my tour of the Dominion’s great cities—so
full of light, racing tramcars, human enthusiasm,
and other forms of electricity—Canada became typified
in my mind as The Man Without a Waistcoat; for the
energetic citizen permits himself that toilet modification
during the brilliant summer months. But an abstract
personification was destined to be superseded in my
thoughts by a definite human example. In J. R. Booth
I felt that I had met the spirit and genius of Canada
in the flesh.
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I went to him under the conditions which had the
sanction of national usage—that is to say, I went
without introduction or appointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old man, thick-set and of medium height, with
white beard and clean-shaven upper lip; an old man
in a suit of dark grey homespun, with peaked cap to
match; an old man standing by himself, thinking, in
the lee of a wooden shed—that was the multi-millionaire
as I happened to find him. It is not many persons who
have found him thus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A while ago Sir Robert Perks dropped in from the
Old Country to discuss high finance with the Lumber
King of Canada. Sir Robert was shown into an office,
where he presently was much astonished by the entrance
of an elderly individual in overalls, sprinkled with red
dust and mortar. The old man on that occasion had
been laying bricks. Visitors sometimes find him at
the bottom of an excavation showing his men how to
lay concrete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was someone with me who, when we saw
him standing beside the wooden building, said that
was J. R. Booth. I should not have known. At a
casual glance he might, even in Canada, have been
anybody; in England he could easily have been mistaken
for nobody. But when I stepped forward and
spoke to that upright, impassive old man, when I confronted
his calm, strong countenance, with its wise,
blue, penetrating eyes, I realised the presence of J. R.
Booth. I cannot find the right word to reflect the
impression he produces. The strength of simplicity;
the oak pillar or marble column unadorned; a man
content to lean on mind instead of manner—those are
but imperfect suggestions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked if I might go over his works, and he said
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
“Yes.” I asked if I could have a chat with him afterwards,
and again he said “Yes.” For he is a straightforward
Aye-and-Nay talker—there is no polite pretending,
no verbal embroidery, with J. R. Booth. He
struck me as being the rare human marvel—a genius
without vanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Genius is not an exaggerated definition. J. R.
Booth gave the first clues to his future career at an
early age by doing something that his relatives considered
silly and something else that they considered
insane. I should mention he came of a stock of seven
brothers Booth who, over a century ago, emigrated
from Ireland to Waterloo—a district within that vast
stretch of Quebec territory known as the Eastern Townships.
There they toiled, prospered, and multiplied;
and it came to pass that J. R. Booth, of the rising
generation, had to plough, chop wood, and tend stock.
But homestead duties did not monopolise the young
man’s attention. It was in his mind that the utmost
power of a man’s body can accomplish but a minute
fraction of the work waiting to be done in the world;
and, undeterred by the titters of his intimates, he put
in a lot of private time constructing amateur watermills
on a rivulet that coursed through the paternal
property. Those wheels were running in his mind
when, at the age of twenty-one, he broke away from
the traditions of his youth, and, with no more than
nine dollars in his pocket, set forth to conquer the
world in his own way, the good people of Waterloo
shaking their heads over the departure of one whom
they feared must be crazy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We may jump a few years spent bridge-building in
the States, and so come to the time, fifty-eight years
ago, when J. R. Booth, a carpenter without capital,
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
stood on the banks of the River Ottawa, bending an
appreciative eye on the Chaudière Falls. There they
were, rushing and roaring—a mighty volume of sustained
force running to waste. J. R. Booth decided
that they were what he was looking for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lower rungs of the ladder were quickly mounted—from
factory hand to foreman, from foreman to tenant
of a mill, from tenant to owner. A bank was willing
to back such a man; and at a public auction J. R.
Booth bought, for £9,000, a large territory endowed
with timber wealth which—as he had taken the precaution
to ascertain—was almost incalculable. Local
lumbermen regarded the transaction as hopelessly vast
and audacious. But with J. R. Booth it was just a
beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From having water-wheels on the brain, he now had
them on the Ottawa, where they propelled powerful
machinery that hauled and sliced his logs. The reader
will not, of course, confound this time-honoured water-power,
as used at the place of its occurrence, with
modern “white coal,” which is water-power in a fluid,
invisible form that lends itself to distribution. J. R.
Booth had not introduced a new method. He merely
introduced an old method into a new place. By the
one plan you must bring your factory to the waterfall;
by the other plan you send the waterfall, along
a metal cable, to the factory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Chaudière cataract illustrates the latent resources
of Canada, J. R. Booth illustrates the qualities
that go to make good Canadians—those men with
daring imaginations, industrious brains and educated
hands. But he is not the type—he is a supreme
example. It is as though Nature had prepared a
store of business capacity sufficient for a townful of
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
merchants, and then, on second thoughts, had bestowed
it all on one man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So fully did J. R. Booth post himself on the
practical details of logging and lumbering, so securely
did he lay the foundations of every fresh extension of
his enterprise, that, of all the forest properties in the
world, his became the largest. Mr. Paul E. Bilkey
put the case comprehensively when he wrote: “Rivers,
streams big and little, snow-covered forest tracks, roads
that are good and roads that are bad and roads that
are no roads at all, lead ultimately to the coffers of
J. R. Booth; veins and arteries stretching over two
great provinces and an American State, parts of or
tributaries to a great industrial system whose heart
pulsates day and night at the Chaudière, to the uttermost
agency devised and dominated by the genius of
one man—Booth.” And again: “The river is bitted
and broken to do the work that Booth requires it to
do: turns the wheels of his mills, takes the logs and
timbers down through his slides, floats his noisy tugs
and carries his booms; and Booth, to keep it all going,
draws upon a timber empire in the north which, if
strung out in a line a mile wide, would stretch from
Quebec to Victoria.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus to measure the scope of this colossal enterprise
your imagination must first roam over large
areas of Ontario and Quebec, and then (J. R. Booth
having felt cramped in a little place like Canada) take
cognisance of great slices of the United States. But
it is easier to find the limits of the business than of
the brain that controls it. Of that brain, the more
obvious feature is its organising power. For J. R.
Booth is the sole and actual head of the vast concern.
It is not run by a syndicate or a company. He easily
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
and successfully carries a burden of mental responsibility,
and exercises a volume of mental control, that
would suffice to keep half a dozen boards of directors
out of mischief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the most remarkable feature of this brain, I
think, is its capacity for detail. It is not only a mental
telescope that sees things too large for ordinary vision;
it is a mental microscope that detects minutiæ invisible
to most men. I will give two illustrations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A certain amount of carting having to be done,
there are some five hundred horses at the Booth lumber
yards, and, one of them recently dying suddenly overnight,
it was replaced within an hour or so by the
responsible foreman. “Where did the new horse come
from?” asked the eagle-eyed old man next morning,
soon after arriving on the scene at seven o’clock, as is
his daily custom. The other incident occurred one
afternoon, when many hundreds of the hands were
streaming homeward on the conclusion of their day’s
work. The old man, standing by, called to one of
the men by name. Said the venerable employer:
“Are you satisfied with your wages?” “Yes,” was
the reply. “Then why do you steal my property?”
came the further inquiry. At first the man made
faltering protestations of innocence, but when requested
to raise the lid of his dinner-can—which, indeed,
proved full of copper nails—he confessed his fault in
an extremity of penitence and dismay. The old man—who,
by the way, associated a reprimand and a warning
with forgiveness—had not been blind to the fact
that a dinner-can swings in one way if empty (which
is its normal state at four o’clock in the afternoon),
and in another way if it be full of metal.</p>

<p class='caption'>PUMPKINS GROWN IN QUEBEC PROVINCE (<span class='it'>see page <a href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>)</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>And all this time I have been speaking of J. R.
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
Booth merely in his capacity of Lumber King. He
is other things as well. For example, he has long
been a wood-pulp magnate. You get a tree, and
pound it into a fibry mass which, with added water,
resembles thick oatmeal porridge; and when you have
spread that mess out and let it partly dry, it rolls up
like a thick, coarse blanket, in which form you can
ship it across the ocean to be the basis of the great
reels of paper that feed the daily Press. The old man
acquired the necessary knowledge and machinery for
doing that class of business, and he does it on a grand
scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus on my conducted tour of inspection there was
much to see. First, I beheld a stretch of river where
the water was hidden by wood—logs floating end to
end and side by side, giving a ribbed surface to the
vista, which suggested acres of a Brobdingnagian
corduroy. They look flat and tame—those trees without
roots or leaves or branches. Here one saw the
forest suspended midway between the poles of its
destiny—no longer an asylum for birds and beasts,
nor yet house and furniture for man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew something of the stages through which that
floating timber had passed. For I have penetrated
into Canada’s lofty jungle and visited the camps where
companies of sturdy men fell the trees and saw them
into logs, and haul those logs to the nearest river,
along which they are borne by the current or drawn
by tugs, until at last they join the dense congregation
of their fellows massed within sight of the mill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now saw the places where, one by one, the logs
were pushed within reach of mechanism that lifted
them out of the water and bore them up an incline,
thence to be delivered into the maw of complex,
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
ingenious, deafening, ruthless machinery. You had
some inkling of the force of the Chaudière Falls when
you saw what that force was doing. Metal platforms
went racing airily about with huge logs as though they
were featherweights. Sometimes a great blundering
log would roll off the platform, whereat a devilish iron
arm arose out of the floor and pushed all that timber
tonnage back into position. Always the heavily
burdened platform was running forward; and, looking
ahead, you saw an obstruction along the route—an
obstruction of whirling, shrieking machinery. Still
looking, you saw the logs, without any jarring or delay,
melt miraculously through the obstruction as if they
were no more substantial than cloud. And on the
other side they were logs no longer, but merely clusters
of planks—circular saws having sliced them like so
much cheese.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those vast chambers of clean, quick mechanism—fed
at one end with tree-trunks, and elsewhere belching
forth streams of boards, beams, laths, and shingles,
with avalanches of chips and cascades of sawdust—in
those vast chambers, I say, one’s ears are put out of
service by the shrieking din, and the visitor has the
more occasion for his eyes. He must walk circumspectly,
lest peradventure he be hurled hence by an
iron arm, and cut with swift precision into thin, wet
slices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the lumber mills I passed into regions where
J. R. Booth makes wood pulp. My guide began by
introducing me to a grinder—a huge affair that
swallows six tons of logs a day and files them to fibre.
Twenty-two of these grinders were growling away at
their mammoth meals, and there were others, I learnt,
in process of construction. It was certainly a case of
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
lost identity with the thick, grey stuff that went flowing
on to the screens. That it had once been the solid
part of a forest was a thought as unthinkable as that
little boys would soon be running about with it in
distant cities, shouting “’Orrible murder! Lytest
special!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The screens are discriminating. The bulk of the
fibre passes through a one-hundredth-of-an-inch aperture,
and is good for paper. Then the residue runs on
a screen having apertures of about a sixtieth of an
inch; and while that which penetrates the interstices
is available for fine cardboard, that which remains
above is suitable for coarse cardboard. Now the several
streams of porridge are pumped upstairs to wet-presses
that contain revolving cylinders. You next see the
stuff clinging to a hurrying felt band that transfers it
to wooden rollers. When several thicknesses have
wound round a roller, they are cut with a pointed
stick, removed, and folded; and there you have your
mechanical ground pulp, which is nothing but washed
wood fibre loosely matted by water. That mechanical
ground pulp constitutes about three-fourths, in bulk,
of paper used by the daily and weekly Press. I was
conducted to the range of buildings where J. R. Booth
makes the constituent which, with certain small accessories,
completes the substance of our news-sheets.
Again logs are the raw material. But this time they
are not ground. They are first despoiled of their bark
by one piece of mechanism; then by another piece
of mechanism they are cut into chips. It seems ungracious
to criticise a machine; but I observed that
the “chipper” is apt to be a little remiss. Some of the
chips it turns out are rather larger than J. R. Booth
requires them to be. So all are subjected to a
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
screening test, those of excessive size being dealt with in an
auxiliary apparatus called a “re-chipper.” The little
nuggets of wood are now sent upstairs in a carrier,
and shot into big bins, each of which holds nearly
two hundred tons. Thence they pass through funnels
into great steel digesters, in which they are packed
down close with long iron rods. The digesters have
an acid-proof lining of bricks and cement; and, to be
informed of the reason for this, I was taken downstairs
again. We visited a part of the premises which, by
reason of certain fumes, suggested “Paradise Lost.”
I am not a chemist, and I cannot describe what the
agents of J. R. Booth were doing with their immense
supplies of lime and sulphur. It must suffice to say
that they produced sulphurous acid and a horrid
smell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The former is conveyed to the upper story, and
pumped into the digesters, previously packed with
chips. “Digester” is the technical and literal description,
for the acid-saturated wood is now cooked with
steam for ten or twelve hours, at the end of which
time it is reduced to white fluff. After being washed
in cold water it is called sulphite, and is ready to be
mixed with mechanical ground pulp to form paper,
small quantities of china clay, size, soda-ash, resin,
and blue and red earth being added as a kind of
seasoning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such, at least, is J. R. Booth’s recipe; for I found
that, by a recent addition to his manifold activities,
he now makes paper. They took me through the mill,
a long building containing several machines stretched
out in a perspective of great cylinders, suggesting the
segments of a huge iron caterpillar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed that the mixture of pulp, sulphite, and
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
accessories has to pass through a refining engine on
its way from one receptacle to another. Afterwards
I saw it pouring like gruel on to each caterpillar’s tail.
Under a shower-bath of water sprays—necessary for
breaking bubbles—the liquid paper ran on to rotating
screens, and was received on moving belts of wire
gauze. The endless web of grey liquid soon became
a web of white substance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My companion bade me note the “suction box.”
This was a gap in a metal cylinder, and as the material
ran over that gap it was sucked inward, with consequent
loss of moisture. Now watch its gliding,
serpentine course over thirty cylinders, heated by
steam, until, finally—as dry, warm, immaculate paper—it
is wound into rolls of from four to five miles. Its
journey has been to and fro, back and turn, for the
cylinders are ranged in double and treble tiers; yet
but a minute or so elapses between the fluid state and
the finished stage, each caterpillar reeling off paper
at the pace of 525 feet per minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have forgotten how many tons of J. R. Booth’s
paper are now absorbed by England, what quantity
goes to the States, and the proportion consumed in
Canada; but I remember that thirty-nine rolls make
a car-load, and that those destined for an ocean voyage
are furnished with an extra wrapper and have their
edges protected by burlap hessian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be talking with the Lumber King is to find
yourself in the presence of a man unlike anyone you
have ever met before, the reason being that J. R.
Booth is content to be J. R. Booth. As a matter of
fact, everybody is unlike everybody else; but the
average mortal disguises his personality with conventionalities
of manner, so that only after a while,
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
and from chance clues, do you “get to know him.”
J. R. Booth is natural and genuine even at a first
acquaintance; in this respect, as in others, being a
conspicuous example of a national virtue. For, whereas
the island-bred Briton loves to present a surface of
polished veneer, the Canadian is satisfied to be solid
oak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To have briskly opened the door, to have entered
the office graciously smiling, to have uttered a few
formal words of welcome—that is how it would have
been with most people. That is not how it was with
J. R. Booth. Sitting sideways at the corner of the
table, I did not know he had arrived until, on turning,
I found him, with head thoughtfully bent, quietly
seated at right angles to me. A bearing so devoid
of pretence wins instant confidence and respect, if at
first it be a little disconcerting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was left to me to start the conversation, and I
plunged into some unpremeditated talk about trees.
What was the best sort for paper-making? Hemlock,
he explained, was good, but any kind of hard timber
would do if it hadn’t gum in it. Gum prevented the
acid penetrating the fibre. Couldn’t they extract the
gum? Yes; they were learning how to do that, and
paper had been made from pitch pine after the turpentine
and gum were extracted. Did his own processes
yield any by-products? Well, a good deal of gummy
substance came out of spruce during the cooking process,
but it was mixed with the acid, and a market for
it had not been found. “Except for the acid,” said
J. R. Booth thoughtfully, “it would make good chewing-gum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an interrogatory spirit, I mentioned the great
trees of British Columbia. But the old man shook
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
his head. There was, it seemed, a great deal of pitch
in them. “I don’t know of any place in the world,”
he added, “where, for softness and lightness and durability,
you would get anything to match our white
pines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all this time—as the keen blue eyes seemed
fully aware—my questions were unrelated to the matter
uppermost in my mind. I really did not feel curious
about the trees. It was not my intention to start a
rival pulp and paper mill. I was not even proposing
to write a treatise on the subject. My desire was to
gain some clues to the working of an abnormal business
brain. I sought to lead the conversation in that
direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much paper did he make? One hundred tons
a day, and about forty tons of cardboard. How many
hands did he employ? In summer, 2,400 at the mills,
and very nearly as many more in the woods. Then I
gave tongue to my thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paper-making is obviously a very delicate and
complex matter,” I said. “How came you to strike
out in that new direction at the age of eighty, and
when you already had such vast undertakings to
engage your attention?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had I asked him the time, he could not have
replied with greater readiness or in a tone more matter
of fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “paper requires a great deal of
care. When I took it up I didn’t know anything about
it, and that was a little disadvantage for a while. You
ask why I took it up. Well, I had a railroad—four
hundred miles—and I sold it. I felt rather lost without
my railroad. So I took up paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could any explanation be more complete or more
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
simple? J. R. Booth hadn’t enough to occupy him,
so he “took up paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before going further with our conversation, I ought
to explain what lay behind that other simple sentence:
“I had a railroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From an admirable biographical sketch in
<span class='it'>Collier’s</span> I take the following interesting facts:
“Booth had no idea of becoming a railway owner till
Governor Smith, of Vermont, came along one day and
told a hard-luck story. Smith and his associates had
started the Canada Atlantic as a feeder to the Central
Vermont, and the enterprise was costing money. They
asked for the co-operation of Booth. They got it; and
one day J. R. Booth woke up to the realisation that
he must take the work over and carry it on himself
if it was to be done at all. It might be throwing good
money after bad, and it might not. Booth plunged
again. He built the Canada Atlantic from Couteau
Junction to Depôt Harbour, and he built the Ottawa,
Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway, four hundred
miles of main line and a hundred miles of sidings.
He bought engines and cars and he built shops. There
being no terminus on the Georgian Bay, he created
a terminus. When the line was nearly completed to
the bay, he invited the Premier of Canada, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier—then in his first year of office—to go over it
with him. They went to the end of the steel, and
from there walked half a mile to the shores of the bay,
described by Sir Wilfrid as ‘a bleak shore, without
a building upon it.’ ‘This,’ said J. R. Booth, ‘is
the terminus of my railway.’ The Prime Minister
asked: ‘Where is your trade to come from?’ Booth
answered: ‘I shall have to create it. I shall have to
collect it from Port Arthur, from Duluth, from Chicago,
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
and from both sides of the lakes. I shall have to
build elevators. I shall, perhaps, have to buy wheat
in order to furnish trade for my railway.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that the one-time bridge carpenter told the
Prime Minister he would do he did. He made Depôt
Harbour. He built elevators. He put a line of
steamers upon the lakes, and he forced so much of
the Western trade into a new channel down through
Ontario that the Canada Atlantic was carrying yearly
two hundred thousand tons of flour and package freight
and twenty million bushels of grain. The man who
built it had seen to it that the railway was a good one.
Other people saw that it was a good one. The
Canadian Northern hankered after it. Seward Webb,
of New York, went so far as to get an option on it—an
option which is said to have left the New York
financier poorer and J. R. Booth richer by a quarter
of a million. The Conservative Opposition in the
Canadian Parliament wanted the country to buy the
Canada Atlantic, and join it to the Inter-Colonial as
an alternative to the Grand Trunk Pacific project. The
Government refused to do it, because they said that
they could not do what J. R. Booth had done. Then
along came the Grand Trunk and took the Canada
Atlantic, and John R. Booth put fourteen million
dollars down into his clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think he must, at first, have been glad to be rid
of his railroad responsibilities. At any rate, that was
one of the occasions when, as though in festive mood,
he played the part of Santa Claus in the family circle,
presenting each of his two sons and each of his two
daughters with one million dollars—a little attention
certainly calculated to fortify a parent in the esteem of
his children.
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as we have learnt, any temporary feeling of
relief was followed by a sense of not having enough
to do; and so he set in to assist feeding the newspaper
Press and the cardboard users of Europe and North
America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now to resume the report of our conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I said, when he confessed to having felt
lost without his railway, “you still had your enormous
timber business to occupy you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he replied, “I’ve been in lumber so long
that the exciting part of it has got worn off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “exciting part!” Here was a clue, and I
eagerly probed further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the interest lies in the doing, not in the
results?” I asked, speaking from the depths of my
ignorance of what it feels like to be a millionaire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said J. R. Booth, “to build up and afterwards
to improve—that occupies the mind, and is a
great pleasure; but he is a miserable man who gets
to the end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His words carried a note of pathos to the ear.
There was no mistaking the implication—a great
organising capitalist, a millionaire many times over,
was suggested as a case for compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not speak. The earnest expression of those
blue eyes told me there was more to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The advantage,” J. R. Booth went on, “is certainly
with the manual worker, as distinguished from
the man who does the mental part. If he is healthy,
and sleeps well, and eats well, no man enjoys life more
than the working man. Only,” he added ruefully,
“you can’t make him believe it. I have been in both
places, and I prefer the heavy end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those words were ringing in my memory when,
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
later in the afternoon, I was talking with one of J. R.
Booth’s lieutenants. He was telling me something that
I scarcely needed to be told, namely, that the entire
staff felt, not merely respect, but personal affection
for the old man—the wonderful old man whose knowledge,
patience and industry seemed without limit;
the old man who was never known to be beaten by a
difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even while we were talking I chanced to look
through the glass panel of a door that gave entrance
to an inner office. In that office I again saw J. R.
Booth. But it was J. R. Booth in a new aspect—an
aspect that held my eyes enthralled. The Lumber
King was leaning over a desk studying some document,
his face alight with interest, yet immovable as marble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only once before in my life had I seen that absorbed
expression on a human countenance. I was being conducted
over the library of the late William Ewart
Gladstone, while the venerable statesman sat there
writing at his table near the window. A member of
the family accompanied me, and began to explain, in
a loud voice, the space-saving arrangement of the
books. “Hush!” I whispered, “we must not disturb
Mr. Gladstone.” “He will not hear,” came the hearty
reply. “I had no idea,” was my comment, “that his
deafness was so serious.” “Neither is it,” I was informed;
“but when Mr. Gladstone is absorbed in
mental work a pistol-shot would not disturb him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unmoving face I saw last year in the Ottawa
office, like that other unmoving face I saw years ago
in the Hawarden library, seemed mesmerised, and to
have the power of mesmerising me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was paying but scant attention to my companion’s
explanations about some knotty business problem that
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
had arisen to engage the attention of J. R. Booth. It
was a matter, he mentioned, that must be settled
before the mail went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this I pricked up my ears, realising, with a
curious sense of regret, that the old man’s present
ecstasy would be short-lived. This thought brought in
its train a further reflection: obviously the paper enterprise
was now running on a smooth and perfected
basis. Therefore it must have lost its efficacy as a
substitute for the railroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When does Mr. Booth start his new venture?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” exclaimed my astonished companion, “you
surely have not heard——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hastened to explain that I spoke from the merest
abstract conjecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange!” he rejoined. “As a matter of fact, a
new departure is in contemplation. Come back here
in two years’ time, and—well, I think you will be
interested in what you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Montreal, like Quebec, is rich in historic associations,
fine old buildings, and French-Canadians. To stand on
Mount Royal—a precipitous park rising to a height of
seven hundred and forty feet—and look down over the
magnificent, ruddy city of domes and spires, with the
St. Lawrence sweeping away into a lilac haze of
Canadian geography, is a thrilling experience one never
forgets. When I last saw that scene, little birds were
singing in overhanging trees, and I heard the peaceful
music of bells ringing in the old convents far below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In point of population, and because it is the headquarters
of commerce, shipping and railways, Montreal
holds the title of the metropolis of Canada. Its shops
and theatres are superb, and greatly have I enjoyed my
sojourns in that city. It makes a wide appeal to one’s
sympathies. It belongs not only to the present, but
to the past. It represents old Canada and new Canada.
It contains both Protestants and Catholics. And
because of its manifold merits and ineffable charms,
Montreal misses the quality that makes Toronto so
fascinating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not that the two cities admit of comparison. As
well might one weigh the attractions of Bruges against
those of New York, or set the useful qualities of chalk
against the nutritive value of cheese. Montreal is a city
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
of to-day and yesterday. Toronto is a city of to-day
and to-morrow. The history of Montreal would make
an interesting fat volume; Toronto’s two-pennyworth
of history would go into a paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I admire Montreal. But I simply fell head over
heels in love with Toronto. It has a population of
350,000 progressive optimists. The whole city is full
of bustle, but of bustle without hustle. It is a hive of
healthy and vivacious industry. Toronto lives at the
brisk pace that keeps the blood in a healthy glow. The
people have discovered the happy mean between the
hurry that wrecks nerves and the sloth that impairs
digestion. Everybody in Toronto seems to be busy for
the sheer joy of the thing. Tread on a man’s foot in
that city and, instead of swearing, he smiles—then
goes bustling off on whatever matter of business may
happen to engage his enthusiasm. Nobody in Toronto
gave me the impression of working under a sense of
mere necessity. Everybody seemed to find his or her
daily occupation an absorbing hobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a word, the spirit of Toronto is the newest spirit
of the New World, undiluted. The life of Toronto is
the life of modern Canada as developed amid the
amenities of a city; and the life of modern Canada is
the life of modern England—with the care and worry
left out. The mechanic commands his £5 a week; a
living wage, with some margin for luxuries, is accessible
to everyone. The loss of a berth in London is
apt to be a catastrophe. The loss of a berth in Toronto
doesn’t matter—you can easily get another. Hence
the prevailing optimism. And optimism is a condition
of progress. When a man is not living in daily dread
of what the morrow may bring forth he dares to do
things.
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Toronto is a dashing, go-ahead, clean, handsome,
well-governed city. It is not run in the interests of
ground landlords and private monopolies. The inhabitants,
when they pay their five cents for a ride by
electric tramcar (and you go as far as you like for that),
are putting money into their own pockets. Indeed, the
municipal revenue from the tramway traffic since 1891
has totalled about £1,000,000, the annual instalments
having appreciably assisted to keep down the rates.
The tramway system is not a haphazard growth—it is
not, as in some English cities, a tangle of unrelated
parts. It is a scientific unity supplying means of quick
transit over the twenty-eight square miles on which
the city stands. No one dreams of walking any distance
in Toronto. Its electric cars annually carry a number
of passengers equal to the population of the United
States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toronto, I say, breathes the spirit of progress and
of the opening era—of the good new times controlled
by a concern for the many, instead of for the few.
Still in its early youth, Toronto is already one of the
notable cities of the world. It is growing vigorously.
Measure its future greatness if you can.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no need to preach Garden City principles
in Toronto. Its administrators will never be under
the necessity of seizing upon half-rood burial grounds,
and clearing off the gravestones, in order to provide a
gasping population with a little live air. In addition
to broad, tree-planted thoroughfares, Toronto has fifty
parks and gardens, covering an area of over fifteen
hundred acres. Not that the city is in any danger of
running short of unpolluted atmosphere, since it is
situated beside a lake that is wider than many parts of
the English Channel and nearly two hundred miles
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
longer. Moreover, electric power from Niagara obviates
the nuisance of smoky chimneys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another source of substantial civic revenue is the
water supply—that advantage being accompanied by
the boon of low charges to the consumer. For a four-roomed
house the annual water rate is 8s. 4d., subject
to an increase of 2s. 1d. for every additional room, and
to a like charge for a bath; while by meter the tariff is
a trifle over 3d. per 1,000 gallons for ordinary manufacturers
and nearly 8½d. for brewers. The local
exchequer also derives considerable assistance from a
system of licensing the vocations that derive profit from
the organisation of a populous city. Thus the bill-poster,
the milkman, the fish pedlar, the plumber, and
the rag collector are among those who pay toll to the
tune of 4s. 2d. per annum; the cab-driver being let off
lightly with a fee of 1s. 0½d. The proprietor of an
ice-cream parlour or of a wax-work show has to disburse
£1 0s. 10d.; the auctioneer’s yearly tax is
£10 8s. 4d.; while the owner of each of Toronto’s one
hundred and ten taverns has to pay £340 for his annual
licence. With regard to the last item, I may mention
that, Canada being a free country, there are places in
Toronto where a man may consume alcoholic refreshment,
either in moderation or to excess, according to
his individual bent; but neither in Toronto nor elsewhere
in Canada do you find liquor shops at almost
every corner, and dotted along the principal streets, as
in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as I have already hinted, what particularly took
my fancy in the Ontario capital was its population.
When the people of Toronto do a thing, they do it
heartily, and therefore well. Let me give an instance
of their thoroughness.
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Some thirty-and-odd years ago the authorities of
the province decided to institute an annual Provincial
Exhibition, and the people of Toronto assisted the
project on the understanding that their city was to be
the scene of the event for two succeeding years. This
concession, if it were ever made, was withdrawn; whereupon
Toronto felt spurred to institute a more important
annual exhibition (on national, instead of provincial,
lines) that should perpetually recur within its boundaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this purpose it set apart an area of 260 acres in
the heart of the city and having a frontage to Lake
Ontario extending for a mile and a half. On that area
it erected exhibition buildings—not temporary edifices
of wood and plaster, but huge, handsome structures of
brick, stone, concrete and steel. Then it beautified the
surroundings with terraces, promenades and flower
gardens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Control was vested in a board of twenty-five directors,
eight being elected by the City Council, eight by
the manufacturing interests of Canada, and eight by
agricultural associations, the remaining seat being
allotted to the Minister of Agriculture. The first exhibition,
held in 1879, was a success, the number of
visitors being 101,794, and the receipts reaching a total
of £11,400, while £3,400 was given away in prizes.
Year by year the scope of the Exhibition has been
enlarged, and year by year the success of the Exhibition
has increased. Last year (1910) the visitors numbered
837,200, the receipts were £58,000, and the value of
prizes £10,260. And note these two remarkable facts:
the Exhibition is open for only a fortnight every year,
and it always shows a handsome margin of profit.
The amount in 1909 was £13,000. This surplus is
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
handed over to the City Council, to be used in extending
the buildings and improving the grounds. When
not in use for the Exhibition the place is available as a
public park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the Toronto Exhibition is popular, prosperous,
and permanent. Special excursions are run to it from
all settled regions of Canada, the railway and steamboat
companies granting reduced rates for the occasion.
Also the event always attracts a host of Americans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is said—and I believe with justice—that so successful
an institution of this character is to be found in
no other country. What is the explanation, the reader
will ask, of this remarkable achievement of a Canadian
city? The only answer I can suggest is—enthusiastic
thoroughness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us glance at the scope of the Exhibition. From
each section of the Dominion the Provincial Government
sends a representative collection of local products.
Distinct buildings are allotted to agriculture, manufactures,
industries, art, transportation, dairying and
machinery. In addition, there are an “Applied Art
Building,” a “Women’s Building,” an “Administration
Building,” a “Press Building,” a “Dog Building,”
and a “Poultry Building.” Stabling is provided for
1,500 horses, 1,200 head of cattle, and 600 swine. A
livestock arena was recently constructed at a cost of
£22,000. There is a grand stand (having a length of
725 feet and seating accommodation for 16,800 persons),
which cost £46,000, and is built of brick, steel and
concrete. Including police and fire stations, telegraph
and telephone offices, a bank, restaurants, rest rooms,
etc., the Exhibition buildings represent a value of nearly
half a million pounds sterling. Apart from visitors,
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
there is a permanent population of ten thousand persons
on the grounds during the annual fortnight.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>THE PERMANENT EXHIBITION AT TORONTO: ONE OF THE BUILDINGS</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>To each day belongs a special interest. Thus, last
year’s diary was as follows: Saturday (August 27th),
Preparation Day; Monday, Opening Day; Tuesday,
Inauguration Day; Wednesday, School Children’s
Day; Thursday, Manufacturers’ Day; Friday, Press
Day; Saturday, Commercial Travellers’ Day; Monday,
Labour Day; Tuesday, Stock Breeders’ and Fruit
Growers’ Day; Wednesday, Farmers’ Day; Thursday,
Americans’ Day; Friday, Fraternal Society and Review
Day; Saturday, Citizens’ Day; and Monday (September
12th), Break-up Day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything that Canada makes and that other
countries sell to Canada is found at the Exhibition.
In 1909 that represented a mammoth collection of goods
which filled the four large buildings devoted to manufactures,
transportation, industries and machinery, besides
overflowing into a Manufacturers’ Annexe, and
into a vast area beneath the grand stand. Even so,
the collection was cramped, so last year, to relieve the
pressure, a special building was provided for British
exhibits. Goods in process of manufacture are a feature
of the Manufacturers’ department, and dense crowds
gather daily to witness the making of silks, cotton,
shoes, and a hundred and one other articles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Exhibition attracts the finest collection of horses
and cattle to be seen in Canada, the number of animals
totalling about ten thousand, and including many herds
specially imported to compete against those bred in the
Dominion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Art Loan Exhibit, selected by a resident agent
in England, affords Canadians an opportunity to see
examples of the great European Masters. Prominence
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
is given to work done in the public schools of Canada,
the co-operation of manual training colleges of the
United States giving an international interest to this
department. New inventions are another strong feature
of the Exhibition. The first electric railway to be seen
on the Continent was operated there, and that may
also be said of the important developments in telegraphy,
telephony, and other branches of applied science
that recent years have witnessed. Nor does the energetic
Board fail to provide high quality in music,
military tournaments, and such frivolities as fireworks
and variety-concert performances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot forbear in conclusion to quote the words
used by the public-spirited directors to describe their
achievement. “The Canadian National Exhibition,”
they say, “is the one place to see Canada at a glance.
It shows all that Canada makes, mines, and grows.
It gathers the products of her homes, her farms, her
forests, her waters, her mines and her industries, within
the limits of the finest Exhibition Park on the North
American Continent. It is recognised from coast to
coast, and from the frozen north to the Gulf of Mexico,
as the greatest of all annual Exhibitions, distinctly Canadian
in its characteristics, and educational in its
tendencies, and yet including so many high-class
amusements and attractions as to make it the annual
holiday centre for three-quarters of a million people
drawn from all parts of North America. And the
number is increasing every year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bravo, Toronto!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span><h1 id='t3283'>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>MANITOBA: CLUES TO PRAIRIE FARMING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Standing on high ground in Manitoba—and also, for
the matter of that, in Saskatchewan and Alberta—you
may gaze upon a vast encircling panorama of grey
grass and gentle undulations, visible in the dry atmosphere
and bright sunshine to a remote purple distance.
That is one sort of prairie, the open sort, so suggestive
of the sea. Also there is bush prairie, with trees and
heavy undergrowth. A third kind is scrub—the resurrected
bush after forest fires have swept it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, whether you be on moor or woodland, you
will see flowers and birds and bees. For Canada is
a land of sunshine, blue sky, and beautiful perfumed
blossoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only by hearsay do I know of the North-West
when the ground is jewelled with violets, blue
anemones, ladies’ slipper, and the bird’s-eye primrose.
I know it well, and like it best, in the season of the
prairie rose—surely the fairest flower anywhere to be
found on the world’s circumference. It is petalled like
our own wild rose, but of a sweet fragrance; the plant
dwarfed and dainty, and nestling against the earth, with
its upturned blossoms ruddy and conspicuous or of
palest pink. I’m sure the fairies pluck buds of the
prairie rose when they go to gather their posies.
Indeed, I am sorry that the maple leaf—eloquently
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
though it advertises the flaming glories of the autumn
foliage—should have been chosen for the national
emblem. Canada will always be to me the Land of the
Prairie Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The queen reigns not in lonely majesty. Prominent
in her court is a royal relative (the three-flowered
geum), an orange-red lily (<span class='it'>Philadelphicum</span>), a scarlet
columbine that dances in the breeze, and the evening
primrose, with fringed gentian and a campanula among
the purples, not to forget the wild bergamot and flax
and a mauve convolvulus. In autumn, Manitoba and
her sister provinces are aglow with nodding sunflowers,
gaillardias, golden rod, Michaelmas daisies, and three
kinds of rudbeckia. Thus the wild nosegay of Canada
has much in common with the garden bouquet of old
England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manitoba is the smallest and (because it contains
Winnipeg) the greatest of the prairie provinces. “It
looks like a postage stamp on the map,” I happened
to remark to its Prime Minister. “Well, sir,” replied
the Hon. R. P. Roblin, with twinkling eyes, “there
are half a million people on your postage stamp, and
that is but a fraction of the population it is able and
destined to maintain. You might report to the English
and Scotch farmers that we have over twenty million
acres of good agricultural land waiting for them here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, of course, the curious fact that, even in the
smallest and most settled of the prairie provinces,
oceans of superb land are still going a-begging. The
area each year surveyed, and thereby rendered available
for occupation, is as large as the area annually appropriated
by the arriving stream of settlers. That stream
is steadily increasing in volume, and to-day thousands
of English and Scotch tenant-farmers, and tens of
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
thousands of their agricultural labourers, are cogitating
the question: “Shall we go to Canada?” Some persons
counsel that course. Others attempt to dissuade them.
But what those hesitating farmers and labourers are
conscious of needing is, not advice, but information—and
information in the form of definite facts rather
than of general statements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with this thought in my mind that I had
approached Mr. Roblin, who is not merely Premier
of Manitoba and its Minister of Agriculture, but one of
the foremost living authorities on Canadian farming,
his knowledge being based on practical experience in
cultivating a large holding in the province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told Mr. Roblin that I desired an authoritative
account of the process known as “breaking the prairie,”
and he very kindly supplied me with the following
particulars:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where the original prairie is thick and tough, it
is customary to break and back-set. The former is
best accomplished with a hand breaking-plough that
has a rolling coulter, but, if the land be very smooth
and level, fairly good work can be done with a sulky
plough. In the case of such smooth land, the breaking
should be shallow, and it is desirable to have the
work completed by the end of June. The sod will be
rotted a few weeks, after breaking, and the land should
then be back-set. This is done by ploughing in the
same direction as before, but to an additional depth
of about two inches, so that fresh soil is brought up
to form a seed bed. Afterwards the land must be made
as fine as possible with a disk-harrow, or similar implement.
Then only a light harrowing will be necessary
in the following spring, when the seed is put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where the land is rough instead of level, thin
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
breaking, of course, will not be practicable. Here the
plough must go to an additional depth of from four to
five inches, and the work should be done as early as
possible in the year. Back-setting is unnecessary, but
there should be a good harrowing to produce a level
surface, as well as a further harrowing before seeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much for the two sorts of open grass land—the
smooth and the rough. Now we come to the land
that is covered with light trees and scrub. It will be
found so very fertile as amply to repay the work involved
in clearing it—work which, of course, bears no
analogy to the task of dealing with the heavily timbered
land to be found in other parts of the continent. The
larger poplars and willows are chopped out, this being
usually done in the winter. Then a fire is run over
the land to burn off the remaining trees and the scrub.
Afterwards the ground may easily be broken with a
strong brush plough, and, when levelling has been
done with a harrow, the seed can go in. Large returns
are yielded by that class of land, of which immense
areas are still obtainable, principally in Northern
Manitoba, either as free homesteads or at a nominal
price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To practical farmers, as well as to other persons
having a grasp of farming principles (and this chapter
is designed to serve the interests only of those two
classes), the foregoing clear and exact statement by
Mr. Roblin will convey a definite knowledge of the
easy agricultural preliminaries that have to be faced,
not only in Manitoba, but also in Saskatchewan and
Alberta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the expert and obliging Premier I sought and
obtained other useful facts about prairie farming.</p>

<p class='caption'>THE OAT HARVEST: EIGHTY BUSHELS TO THE ACRE</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>As to the wheat most suitable for Manitoba, I
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
learnt that many kinds have been grown on the homesteads,
while the search for new knowledge is never
slackened at the Government experimental farms; but
accumulated experience may be summed up in seven
words—there is nothing to beat Red Fyfe. The plant
is healthy and vigorous and very productive, the hard
and white berry having unequalled milling qualities,
with thin bran and high gluten contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning oats, I derived the following information
from the Premier:</p>

<p class='pindent'>With proper care, this grain does very well in
Manitoba, and there is a yearly increase in the demand
(both for feeding purposes and oatmeal), and consequently
an increase in the price obtainable. In some
districts the soil is more favourable for oats than for
wheat. Careful selection of seed and thorough cultivation
result in immense yields, many farmers reporting
an average of eighty bushels per acre on large
holdings. For a number of years the Banner oat has
been most favoured by growers, this being a thin,
hulled sort, very productive, and of excellent quality.
The white varieties, known as Abundance, Ligowa,
and Newmarket, also receive attention and sell at good
prices for milling purposes. What can be done by
good cultivation on the rich soils of Manitoba is illustrated
by this fact: At the Brandon experimental farm,
over a period of five years, the average yield of Banner
oats, on summer fallowed land, and without the use of
a fertiliser, was one hundred and sixteen bushels and
four pounds per acre. In the rotation of crops the
place occupied by oats is usually after wheat and before
either a barley crop or summer fallow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I learnt that the Chevalier varieties of two-rowed
barley have not given satisfaction. Two-rowed
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
Duckbills, such as Canadian Thorpe, are stiffer in the straw,
and, as a rule, the heads fill well. The six-rowed
varieties—notably Mensury and Odessa—have been
found best adapted for general cultivation. They can
be sown later than any other grain, and mature so
early as to escape danger from autumn frosts. It
nearly always happens that the straw is stiff and bright
and that the ears fill well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to fodder crops, I learnt that farmers
in newly-settled districts have no need for them,
abundance of excellent hay being obtainable from the
natural prairie grass on the lower lands and water
meadows. When, with the growth of a district, those
areas are drained and utilised as grain fields, the
farmers have no difficulty in raising fine crops of
timothy, western rye, millet, broom, and other grasses.
Lucerne and the clovers also thrive well under proper
treatment, while Indian corn grows to a height of from
eight to ten feet, and, yielding about twenty tons to
the acre, is excellent as green fodder or as ensilage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having thus gleaned the salient facts as to preliminary
operations and the crops that do well in
Manitoba, I obtained the following particulars as to
methods of farming practised in the province:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most of the wheat crop is grown on land that has
produced a grain crop of some kind during the previous
year. After the stubble land has been ploughed as
early in the autumn as possible, it is furrowed and left
ready for sowing in the following spring. In the case
of new land, this inexpensive method of cultivation
usually results in large profits. Sooner or later, of
course, a regular system of rotation has to be adopted.
The common practice is to include a summer fallow in
the rotation, the grain stubble being usually ploughed
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
in June, when the weed seeds have begun to germinate.
Then the soil is compacted with a sub-surface packer,
or similar implement, this operation being followed,
during the summer, by thorough surface tillage, to kill
weeds and prevent evaporation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of the largest and best crops of wheat are
associated with summer fallowing, which greatly improves
the condition of the soil. The more advanced
farmers include grass in their rotation, timothy or
western rye being usually sown with a nurse crop of
grain, and the land being used for pasture after two
season’s hay crops have been cut. Where clover is
grown, a nurse crop is not recommended, although in
favourable seasons there may be a light seeding of
hay to be cut early as a green feed. Excellent results
have been obtained by ploughing grain stubble in
spring, harrowing once, then sowing about twelve
pounds of red clover to the acre, harrowing again, and
rolling. When weeds of the ‘volunteer’ grain crop
are about a foot high, a mower should be run over
the land, the cuttings being left to form a mulch.
The clover plants become large and well rooted before
the autumn, and there is no danger that they will be
killed by the winter. In the following year two cuttings
of clover can be taken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My attention was drawn to the fact that, the areas
under cultivation being large, farm operations have to
be carried through as expeditiously as possible. Hence
the most improved machinery is in use on the homesteads.
Immediately upon the ripening of the grain,
large binders are set to work, and are kept in operation
from dawn to sunset. At times a score of these
machines, each drawn by four horses, are to be seen
moving in close succession around an immense field,
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
with the result that, in a few days, the crop from
hundreds of acres is safely stooked. In a few more
days the standing grain is cured; then the farm is
visited by one of the threshing outfits, which consist
of powerful steam traction engines and separators.
The threshing is done direct from the stook, and is
carried out so quickly that only a few days intervene
between the ripening of the grain and its delivery on
the market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went into the question of live stock, beginning
with the animal of chief importance in agriculture—the
horse. The application of mechanical power in
farming has gone much farther on the North American
continent than in this country. In England or Scotland
a man has to be content with tilling a farm; in
Canada and the United States the ambitious grain-grower
will often till a landscape, waxing exceedingly
rich in the process. For the man who measures his
land by square miles the seasons are no longer than
for the man who measures his land by acres. He is,
of course, in a position to multiply teams of horses
to any extent, but—human labour being as scanty and
high-priced on one side of the Atlantic as it is cheap
and superabundant on the other—he can never be sure
of securing enough men to drive the teams. So he
turns eagerly to the machines, driven by petrol or
steam, which are being placed on the market in forms
of increasing efficiency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the average Canadian farmer, with his one
hundred and sixty or three hundred and twenty acres,
is dependent upon animal power for ploughing, harrowing,
and reaping; and, therefore, possible emigrants
among our Scotch and English agriculturists will
desire to learn something as to the quantity and, more
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
important still, the quality of the animal power available
on the prairie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history of the horse in Manitoba, I learnt, is
divisible into three chapters. In the early days of
settlement, stock-raising was the mainstay of agriculture,
and the pioneer farmers introduced into the province
some fine horses and cattle, the imported stock thriving
wonderfully on nutritious prairie grasses which had
long sustained vast herds of buffalo. To this day,
indeed, one hears of the magnificent steers that fed on
the sweet upland pastures and revelled belly-deep in
vetches and wild pea-vines. So much for the first
chapter—concerned with the laying of a good foundation,
whereof the influence is felt in some of the best
studs and herds of to-day. Afterwards, Manitoba discovered
how splendidly its soil and climate were adapted
for grain-growing; and everybody turned his back on
stock-raising and went in for wheat. Thus the second
chapter represents a period in which the raising of
horses was neglected. And so we come to the third
chapter; and here I cannot do better than quote Mr.
Roblin:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many a traveller has marvelled at the myriad
beacon fires illuminating the autumn sky from the far-reaching
stubble fields, where the straw piles are burned
as soon as the threshers have completed their task.
This improvident waste, coupled with careless methods
encouraging the introduction and spread of weeds, is
causing the pendulum to swing slowly back again. In
order to improve the mechanical condition of the soil,
to restore exhausted fertility and to control noxious
weeds, the wiser farmers are now cultivating grasses
and clovers, fencing their holdings, and giving serious
attention to the raising of live stock.”
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There are about a quarter of a million horses in
Manitoba to-day, and the supply does not keep pace
with the demand. Until a few years ago the farmers
were dependent upon supplies from east and west and
from the United States; nowadays numerous animals
bred in the province appear in the Winnipeg market,
and command good prices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my part of the Old Country there is a saying that
when it comes to buying a horse a man cannot trust
his own brother; and I learnt from Mr. Roblin that,
even in honest Canada, equine dealings have not always
been above reproach. “Importers from the United
States,” I was advised, “not only brought with them
American-bred stallions, but also introduced American
methods of disposing of them. One of these methods
was commonly known as ‘syndicating.’ Ten or a
dozen farmers were induced to take shares in a stallion,
and to sign notes of joint ownership. In many of these
cases the stallion so disposed of was stated to be worth
from £400 to £800, which was generally three or four
times its actual value. The notes were discounted
before maturity, and the salesmen decamped. Such
practices have done much injury to the horse-breeding
industry, but, happily, they are now almost a thing of
the past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Legislation, I learnt, has been introduced in the
western provinces to foster horse-breeding. The objects
of that legislation are to encourage the use of sound,
pure-bred stallions and to eliminate others. Owners are
compelled, under risk of a penalty, to register stallions
with the departments of agriculture of the several
provincial governments, certificates being issued that
state, in the case of each animal, whether it be pure-bred
or graded, and whether it be sound or unsound.
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
A copy of this certificate must be printed on advertisements
and route-bills and be conspicuously displayed
on the door of every stable occupied by the horse during
the breeding season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Draft breeds are the most popular with prairie
farmers, Clydesdales predominating. There are also
many Percherons and Shires. As numerous registered
Clydesdale mares are stationed throughout the country,
and as a good Clydesdale stallion is to be found on
nearly every section, this breed is likely to maintain its
position. Of horses bred on the average farm, few
would scale up to the draft class, the majority having
to be registered as agricultural horses because they
weigh less than 1,600 lbs., while there are many horses
bred from small nondescript mares that could only be
styled “farm chunks.” Although lacking in weight,
these are useful horses on a farm, being hardy, and
having good wearing qualities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the lighter breeds, I learnt that there
are many American trotting stallions in the country,
and that excellent road horses are produced. Thoroughbreds,
hackneys, and some of the coach breeds have
been introduced into Manitoba, and among the resulting
crosses are a good many saddle and heavy leather
horses. These are useful animals for light farm work
and for certain kinds of road work, but they do not
command high prices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Roblin certified that on the whole the country
is good for horse-breeding, though, against the healthy
climate and the abundance of good feed, one has to
set a rather high mortality among foals from the disease
known as “joint ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to the matter of cattle. And here let
me say that the English or Scotch farmer will gain an
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
excellent idea of Canadian conditions if, taking his
balance sheet for a year, he will remodel it on the
supposition that he has no rent, interest, or tithe to
pay, and only a merely nominal taxation, in respect
to a holding of one hundred and sixty acres or more,
and on the further supposition that he has the free use
of excellent and unlimited grazing outside that holding.
To do this is to translate farming profits secured in one
part of the British Empire into farming profits obtainable
in another part of the British Empire. Indeed,
the difference between the United Kingdom and
Canada, from the agriculturist’s point of view, is this:
in the former country he is allowed to use the air,
sunshine, and rain for his private profit free of charge;
while in the latter country he finds another natural
element also given away, and he no more has to reckon
with a landlord than with an airlord or a rainlord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having owned and tended a cow or two in my time,
and having a fondness for those beasts, I found myself
regarding the prairie herds with a keen interest, and
an interest not wholly free from jealousy. Grain-growing
with up-to-date machinery on ample new acres
that harbour few weeds and need no manure, was a
sufficiently tantalising contrast to the elaborate methods
necessary in an old country where land is precious and
in need of costly fertilisers. But it was hard for an
Essex small-holder to keep his temper on noting the
simple, not to say automatic, lines on which kine may
be kept in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. At
least one cow will generally be retained on the homestead,
and be duly milked, so that the farmer’s wife
may make puddings, and her children grow sturdy on an
unstinted supply of cream and butter; but often enough
the herd is permitted to look after itself and roam at
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
large on any unappropriated and unfenced land, drinking
from rivers and growing fat on the nutritious
prairie grass. I spoke to some farmers who confessed
that, during the greater part of the year, they never see
their cattle and have no definite knowledge of their
whereabouts. Every farmer has his distinctive registered
brand, and, before permitting his animals to depart
on their wanderings, he sees to it that each bears the
mark that will establish and safeguard his ownership.
Where calving takes place in a herd out on free range,
the unbranded youngsters will run with their mothers,
and so remain within the pale of proprietorship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a waste of milk!” was my comment. “Oh,”
the prairie farmer has replied, “I can’t be everlasting
rounding up the bunch to milk ’em. Then look at
the daily bother of sending the stuff into town. No,
sir, wheat is my line, and it pays me best to look after
the land. Of course, the beef end of it is different.
I don’t mind driving a score or so of fat beasts to
market now and again, and it’s a few hundred dollars
easily earned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I will no further pursue the thread of my
personal experiences, since I have designed that this
chapter shall contain comprehensive data, bearing the
stamp of high authority, concerning farming on the
prairie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to cattle, then, Mr. Roblin furnished
me with these particulars:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little Red River cow of early days—rugged,
short-legged, crumple-horned, and brindled—has
almost entirely disappeared. The foundations of
several herds of shorthorns were laid in the early
’eighties, and the progeny of these, and of many
similar herds subsequently established, have been
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
widely distributed throughout the country. Indeed,
the blood of this cosmopolitan breed now flows in the
veins of most of our cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of the special beef breeds, the Hereford and the
Aberdeen Angus are fairly well represented. Where
the calves run with their dams, and beef production
only is desired, both these breeds, as well as Galloways,
are found to answer well. They are good grazers, and
mature heavy, compact carcases of the best quality.
The cows, however, are not such good milkers nor so
docile as shorthorns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of special dairy breeds, the Holsteins are steadily
gaining in favour. They are robust and large-framed,
have great capacity for assimilating ‘roughage,’ and
produce immense quantities of fairly good milk. Ayrshires
and Jerseys have been introduced, but while the
former are numerously represented in the dairying
districts, the latter make no headway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In localities that have been longest settled, wheat
has tended to displace cattle from the sweet grazing
of the uplands and drive them to the lower-lying and
flatter lands, where the grass is coarser and less
nutritious. Consequently there has been some deterioration
in the quality of the herds. But, with the
adoption of more ‘intensive’ methods, including the
growing of corn, clover, and lucerne, and with greater
care bestowed on stabling, better results are accruing.
Already there are indications that cattle-feeding is
receiving due attention in Manitoba, and that cattle-raising
promises to become in this province one of the
most important branches of agriculture. The straw
and screenings of the wheat-field, instead of being
burnt, are destined to be ‘marketed on the hoof,’ the
manure serving to fertilise and mechanically improve
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
the soil, thereby causing the grain crops to give a
greater yield and to mature more quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Mr. Roblin’s statement it will be seen that
already, following the natural evolution of a country’s
agricultural development, the more settled parts of
Manitoba have entered upon the stage of mixed farming.
The factors that make grain-growing so remunerative
have the same influence on dairying.
Manitoba, like Ontario and Quebec, is alive to the
importance of co-operation in this industry, and the
machinery of cream-collection and of butter- and cheese-making
in factories is working on a large and increasing
scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to sheep, Mr. Roblin supplied discouraging
information. So far as climate and soil are
concerned, the prairie provinces are admirably suited
for sheep-raising. Moreover, prices for lamb and
mutton rule high. But the coyote, or prairie-wolf,
while harmless to other stock, preys on sheep. It is
the farmer’s one enemy in the animal kingdom of
Canada. Governments and municipalities offer bonuses
for coyote scalps, and ultimately, no doubt, <span class='it'>canis
latrano</span> will be exterminated. Meanwhile those prairie
farmers who have flocks of Shropshires, Oxfords, and
Leicesters are put to the expense of close fences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Mr. Roblin, “although I speak in this
disconsolate tone about sheep-raising, it has, I believe,
a great future; in this way. The prolific yield of the
earth has caused farmers to become careless and to
allow noxious weeds to grow rampant. Now sheep thrive
and produce excellent mutton on these very weeds,
which means that the sheep-owner is achieving a double
purpose: he is cleaning his land very thoroughly—the
sheep absolutely exterminate the weeds—and he is
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
securing a handsome return from his fine fat sheep in
doing so.” As for the outlet, Mr. Roblin declared that
Winnipeg, “with half the population of Montreal, has
double the demand for mutton.” Indeed, he considers
that the sheep-raiser finds a better local market in
Manitoba than anywhere else in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the advance of dairying, hog-raising is
assuming importance. But, as Mr. Roblin pointed out,
every farmer can, if he chooses, cheaply rear without
milk a few swine on by-products that would otherwise
be wasted. Not enough pork is produced in Central
Canada to supply the local demand, but market conditions
do not greatly encourage the industry. As the
people of Manitoba want light, mild-cured bacon and
hams, Yorkshires and Berkshires stand in chief favour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, I gathered these further facts of interest
to anyone who contemplates tilling the prairie soil:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Currants, gooseberries, raspberries, and strawberries
have long been cultivated profitably in
Manitoba; and of late years some hardy apples have
proved successful on the Siberian crab. All garden
vegetables, save a few that require a long season, are
grown to a high state of perfection in the prairie provinces.
Eggs and poultry command a good market and
receive increasing attention. Following upon the widespread
cultivation of clover, bee-keeping has become
easy and profitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To watch the development of North America is to see
Nature performing an endless conjuring trick with the
human race. At New York, Quebec, and the other
ocean ports there is that interminable procession of
arriving liners, crowded in the steerage with persons
who, in face, speech, clothes, ideas, and demeanour, are
foreigners—foreigners obviously, and, as would seem,
unalterably—yet when you travel about the country
you make the bewildering discovery that they are not
there. A family of newly landed foreigners, it is true,
you may chance to fall in with, but the accumulated
mass, the avalanche of emigrants who have been arriving
in daily thousands for tens of years past—they have
mysteriously vanished. And in their place you see
millions of Yankees and Canadians who have dropped,
apparently, from the skies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The process of absorption, of adaptation, of transmogrification,
is rapid, as two personal incidents may
serve to show. Crossing the Atlantic recently, I happened
to be standing in the between-decks promenade
of the steerage, with my attention engaged by a group
of inert Scandinavians, who—because of their strange
attire and talk, their clumsy movements, and their
wondering eyes looking out helplessly from flabby
countenances—seemed creatures from another planet.
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
By way of contrast, there stood at my side a dapper
little elderly man in a cowboy hat, and having alert and
penetrating eyes and a neatly trimmed tuft of hair on
his otherwise clean-shaven face—in a word, the typical
smart Yankee as one sees him on the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” said I, a trifle dubiously, “those people
will somehow settle into shape out in the West?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess they will,” murmured the calm little
Yankee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They certainly look a most unpromising lot,” I
blundered on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they might improve,” drawled my companion
in the same even tone, and still looking straight
ahead of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They appear to be so uncouth,” my evil genius
prompted me to add, “so dull, so lacking in brains
and breeding. In fact, they almost seem like——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” said the little Yankee, as he turned
to confront me, not indeed with any show of resentment,
yet with a suggestion of mild protest in his keen
gaze. “Some o’ your ideas on this subject might not
be just exactly what I should think. I’m Scandinavian
born myself, having come over—a boy of fourteen—in
a party as like as two peas to that one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There remained for me, of course, nothing but a
hurried confession that I should not have thought it,
since, to my eyes, he looked the walking incarnation of
everything that was bright, quick and admirable in
the American character: which did something to patch
up our relationship; but I am not likely to forget the
lesson that, in talking to a Yankee or a Canadian, one
is very likely confronting a dual nationality, with half
of it hidden from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My other experience concerns a little girl named
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
Dolly. As I knew her before she and her people went
to Canada, Dolly was a timid, clinging, winsome mite
who, as the saying goes, could not say boo to a
goose. Before the family had been a year in the new
country I had the pleasure of visiting them in their
home on the prairie. All were the same as I had known
them before, and yet all, in some subtle way, were
different. They had become infected by a spirit I can
only describe as Canadian—by something that showed
itself in a sort of hearty self-reliance—by something
that Dolly illustrated for me in a very definite and
memorable manner. Entering the parlour one afternoon,
I found her a-perch the music stool, industriously
playing the piano. “That doesn’t sound much
like a piece, Dolly,” I happened to remark; “it’s an
exercise, isn’t it?” “You bet your life it is,” replied
the complacent child, without turning her head or
desisting from her performance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rapid assimilation of peoples is, in fact, a law
of social development in North America. But the
working of that law has, in the case of the Dukhobors,
been suspended; and I have been laying emphasis on
the rule only that my readers may be able more clearly
to appreciate the exception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went to Verigin, the headquarters of the Quaker-like
Russian vegetarians—the strange sect who were
assisted to Canada by Count Tolstoy and a committee
of European well-wishers, and who have since given
some trouble to the Dominion authorities by declining
to take the oath of citizenship and by perambulating
the country naked in search of a Messiah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found a few Dukhobors living in ordinary Canadian
houses at Verigin proper, where the community
has a range of offices, a warehouse, a brick-yard, a
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
wheat elevator, and a flour-mill fitted with up-to-date
machinery. Also there I found a handful of other
nationalities (notably a Scotch family and a Roumanian
family, who have both become Canadian), and they
testified with two voices concerning the peculiar people
in the midst of whom they dwell. But before referring
to lines of cleavage in local opinion, I will briefly
give my own superficial impressions of a community
whose main principles have always engaged my sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They decline, on grounds of conscience, to serve
as soldiers, and I happen to regard warfare between
civilised nations as a hateful folly, admitting the peaceful
and rational alternative of arbitration. They also
object to slay animals for food, or for any other purpose,
and, being myself inclined to a non-flesh diet,
I was not likely to quarrel with that item of their
humanitarian creed, even though I personally am unable
to rise to the ethical height of sparing the lives of
vermin. Thus such things as I shall say about these
non-Canadians will at least issue from a mind unpolluted
by prejudice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The local section of the community (for other
sections exist elsewhere in Canada) is distributed among
several villages established within a short radius of
Verigin. To one of those villages—Varnoe—I went
on foot—or, rather, I went part of the way on foot;
for a wagon overtook me on the road, and, addressing
its two occupants (men who, by reason of their unanimated
expressions and a Russian suggestion in the
cut of their clothes, were easy to recognise as Dukhobors),
I asked if they would kindly give me a lift.
That my English was, however, thrown away upon
them their expressionless faces clearly showed, so by
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
pantomime I indicated the way by which I desired to
profit by their indulgence. They vouchsafed no smile
of acquiescence and no frown of refusal; so, without
more ado, I scrambled into the vehicle, which promptly
resumed its journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, had those two Dukhobors been possessed of
even a moderate sense of humour, not to mention the
gift of human sympathy, they must, I think, have
betrayed some passing appreciation of the predicament
in which I had all unwittingly involved myself. For
the wagon had no springs, and I was having the time
of my life in the matter of jolting and jarring, with
stirring sensations as of the dislocation of one’s bones
and the loosening of one’s teeth, as that awful conveyance
went blundering along the rough road. Nor
did occasion arise for any compassionate concern on
behalf of my companions, since the seat they occupied
was fixed to pliable steel supports that must have ensured
for them a reasonable measure of physical comfort.
And when—having had about enough of it—I called a
halt and dismounted from that unsympathetic vehicle,
there was still no sign of fraternity from either of
those two self-centred and apparently depressed Dukhobors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The village—when I presently arrived at it—proved
a surprising place, with strange, foreign-looking and
picturesque houses having walls plastered with mud,
but with a note of distinction in the disposition of the
timbering, in the shaping of the windows, and in the
gable ends of the heavy vegetating roofs. Moreover,
the eye was grateful for variations of detail in the
several structures, no two being exactly alike, though
all were affected by common principles of structure and
design—all, at least, save a central meeting-place in
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
prim brickwork, which was a civilised eyesore in that
setting of primitive architecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the aspect of those Dukhobor dwellings
could not fail to please an artist, their contiguity was
calculated to horrify a social reformer. Here on the
Canadian prairie, where one human habitation to 160
acres is the rule, there seemed something grotesquely
gratuitous in a street of crowded houses, each with a
little backyard that scarce afforded latitude for a pig,
a wash-tub, and three gooseberry-bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men were either afield or indoors. But I saw
a number of women. Some were applying mud to
the walls, using their hands as trowels, and being
copiously bemired from head to foot; others appeared
and disappeared in their little gardens as they went
sluggishly about their household affairs. Indeed, a
sense of the sluggishness of those fat-faced, broad-bodied,
heavily-clothed and big-booted women is the
main impression they left on my mind. There were
some children about, and they also seemed overburdened
with clothes and deficient in vitality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger excited no curiosity, and prompted no
spontaneous greetings. My friendly overtures to the
adults were rewarded with dull nods and a muttered
syllable or two. Those people were all quite happy, I
suppose, but they were living their lives in a minor
key. If one of the boys (not readily to be distinguished,
by the by, from the girls) had only called out or
whistled, or even set up a hullabaloo of blubbering, it
would, I felt, have relieved the tension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After walking twice from end to end of the village,
I determined to see if it were not possible, by hook
or by crook, to make a Dukhobor smile. Squatting
on a seat in front of one of the houses, I laid myself
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
out to secure the companionship of a little child who
stood a few feet away, eyeing me with solemn misgiving.
Not until I had produced my watch, fountain
pen, bunch of keys and penknife, and spread them out
before her, could the dubious youngster be coaxed forward.
Yet her interest in these glittering valuables
proved still-born; all my laborious attempts to show off
their jingling and snappy parts being looked upon
with a coldness bordering on boredom. However, that
stumpy little Dukhobor toddler did at last manifest a
spark of personality by earnestly pointing towards the
grass at my feet; whereupon I plucked a bunch and
held it out to her. The offering was accepted with
alacrity and in a spirit of appreciation; hers being
apparently the well-balanced type of mind which, content
with things familiar and of established worth, is
proof against the glamour of mere novelty. I gathered
another handful of herbage and made a show of also
surrendering that; but this time the chubby little fist
stretched forth only to find the gift denied. Ten
minutes later we were still doing that—attempts at
surreptitious seizure sometimes prevailing against treacherous
withdrawal, and the proceedings being frankly
accepted by my tiny opponent as a legitimate and sporting
way of passing the time. But all this time she
did not smile. Nay, I had already begun to regard my
aspiration as hopeless when, chancing to look round,
I perceived that a Dukhobor woman—presumably the
child’s mother—was overlooking our contest with much
the air of a referee; and when I caught the eye of
that Dukhobor woman she gave me a most gracious
and unmistakable smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon afterwards, I retraced my steps along the road,
and, calling at headquarters, sought an audience of
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
the Dukhobor leader. But Peter M. Verigin, “Representative
of the Dukhobor Society in Canada” (to give
him the modest title which, on his visiting card, he
gives himself), happened to be away on a journey.
However, I was received by Mr. M. W. Cazakoff, the
manager, who, in answer to my inquiries, made the
following statement:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the Dukhobor Society’s trading store,
where we have wholesale and retail departments for the
sale of dry goods, hardware, leather, boots and shoes,
groceries, crockery, farm implements, etc. We have
seven grist mills, including one of 400 horse-power;
three brickyards, where over seven million bricks have
been made; about 800 horses; 800 head of cattle;
twenty-five threshing machines; a number of barns and
stables, and a fine assortment of ploughs, harrows, and
other agricultural machinery. We have 13,000 acres in
Saskatchewan, it being worth at least thirty dollars
an acre, and the Society has now bought 15,000 acres
in British Columbia—at Castlegar, about thirty miles
south of Nelson—where a beginning has been made
with fruit-farming. So you will see that our community,
which numbers between seven and eight
thousand persons, has become rich. The people who
have made trouble for us are not many—not quite a
hundred—and they do not belong to us, and we do
not like what they do. Their Russian name would
be called in English: The Men Without Any Clothes.
We hope they will not make any more bother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said the jovial Scotch miller, when I afterwards
sat chatting with him in his cosy parlour: “I have a
lot to do with the Dukhobors, and you may take it from
me they are very nice people. As for the wild, fanatical
set that sometimes go about with no clothes on, well,
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
they are just the eccentric ones, and they don’t belong
to the regular Society. One day I found a long-haired
individual in the mill among those that work for
me, a-whispering and talking away at ’em fit to beat
the band. I saw what his game was—getting up one
of those naked-crusade outfits to make a lot more
bother. So I took and ran him out of the mill. They
are normally as quiet, harmless, and industrious a
people as you could meet anywhere. And such simple
tastes they’ve got, too! Did you see that little patch
of sunflowers along the road? Well, they grow them
for their own food, and they munch away at the ripe
seed as contentedly as possible. I tried those seeds once—but
never again. A cut from the joint with some
nice gravy is more in my line. All the same, you
can’t help respecting them for their principles, especially
when they are always so nicely behaved. And
as for Mr. Verigin and the other heads of the Society,
you couldn’t want to do business with nicer and more
straightforward gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said the highly intelligent and much travelled
Roumanian storekeeper: “Nobody finds any fault with
the Dukhobors themselves; but the system under which
they live doesn’t give them a fair chance. They
oughtn’t to be kept in their present uneducated state,
and allowed to live in a superstitious belief that Peter
Verigin is their heavenly ruler. The Society make a
boast of the property they have amassed; but what an
infinitely greater amount so many thousand families
would have produced by this time if each man had
been allowed to take up his quarter-section and been a
free and independent citizen, bringing up his children
to be properly educated and to speak the language of
the country, instead of carrying on traditions of
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
ignorance and superstition. As for their objection to bloodshed,
and their preference for a non-meat diet—well,
obviously those ideals can be preserved just as well by
people who are mentally emancipated as by people
living in a state of mediæval darkness. I am happy to
say that, in spite of the measures taken to preserve the
<span class='it'>status quo</span>, a little light is beginning to enter the community
from without, and already many of the men
have struck for independence, and withdrawn from the
community. Some are living hereabouts on their own
homesteads, and very fine and prosperous settlers they
are proving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with what my Roumanian friend said I found
myself in hearty agreement. Having escaped from
the yoke of autocracy to the political freedom of
Canada, the least the Dukhobors can do, it seems to
me, is to shed the mental fetters of an ignorant Russian
peasantry and become enlightened Canadian citizens.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span><h1 id='t4245'>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE HISTORY OF THE C.P.R.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>To establish a great country and christen it after one
of its districts—in other words, to take the name of a
locality and make it apply over a region stretching
away for thousands of miles—is to provide succeeding
generations of schoolboys with an opportunity to form
life-long misconceptions. If, when London was made
into a county, it had been christened Pimlico, we
should have a rough parallel to what happened in the
case of British North America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowing that Canada has existed for more than
three centuries, people are apt (as I have previously
pointed out) to scratch and shake their heads over the
fact that, while the United States in the south have
acquired a population of 92,000,000, Canada numbers
only 8,000,000 inhabitants. It takes a lot of explanation
to make them understand that historic Canada was
a comparatively small area abutting on the St. Lawrence
River; and that modern Canada—the huge country
stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific—is only
thirty-eight years old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have to hammer away at the fact that the word
“union” is the key to the extraordinary contrast afforded
by the population of Yankee North America and the
population of British North America; that the reason
why there was expansion in the south was because
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
the States were united, and that the reason why, until
recent years, there was no expansion in the north was
because, until recent years, the provinces were ununited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were ununited politically (a common allegiance
not involving concerted action) and they were
ununited physically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Political union came by stages. The four principal
eastern provinces (Canada West, Canada East, New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia), as we have seen, joined
forces forty-four years ago; distant Manitoba threw in
its lot with them three years later; remote British
Columbia entered the combination during the following
twelve months, on condition that its isolation should be
remedied by a railroad; and in 1873—or just thirty-eight
years ago—with the adhesion of the remaining eastern
province (Prince Edward Island) there came into existence
the vast Dominion of Canada, embracing not
merely the regions named above, but the enormous
intervening and adjoining areas known as the North-West
Territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Political union was accomplished, but its permanence
was contingent upon physical union also being
accomplished, for British Columbia had stipulated for
a railroad. Thus the newly-created Federal Government
found themselves confronted by a task which for
magnitude and difficulty would have been worthy the
statesmanship of a Julius Cæsar. They had to furnish
their geographical colossus with a steel backbone. They
had to lay parallel rails round a wide arc of the earth’s
circumference—traversing the untracked wilderness,
skirting mountains and chasms, hewing a way through
forests, blasting a way through rock, filling up bogs,
lowering lakes and bridging rivers innumerable; they
had to make a level roadway three thousand miles
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
long, placing sleepers a foot apart along its entire
length, and building stations at intervals of sixteen
miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gigantic enterprise was put in hand; but continuity
of policy proved impossible with a national
executive that was subject to party changes. At the
end of several years only 700 miles of line had been
laid, and the Government were anxious that someone
else should go on with the job. Eight daring capitalists
formed themselves into a syndicate, and undertook to
have the line constructed by 1891 in consideration of
receiving twenty-five million dollars and twenty-five
million acres of prairie. They made splendid progress,
but, presently running short of cash, they asked the
Government to lend them £6,000,000—accommodation
that was granted on the understanding that the line
should be finished in 1886, or five years earlier than
had been originally stipulated. It was finished in
1885, and a few months later trains were running
across Canada from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Hence
its name, The Canadian Pacific Railway—long ago
colloquialised by universal usage into the “C.P.R.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Federation rendered modern Canada possible. But
modern Canada was created by a railway—by that
railway—by the C.P.R. In 1881, before the line was
commenced, the Dominion had 4,324,810 inhabitants,
of whom 4,153,800 lived in the settled areas in the
East—areas forming but a small fraction of the new
country. The balance of population—171,000 persons,
of whom nearly half were Red Indians—was distributed
as follows: 66,000 in Manitoba, 49,000 in British
Columbia, and 56,000 in the remaining far-stretching
regions of Canada. To-day there are more than a
million and a half people in those territories where,
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
before the railway was made, there were only 171,000;
and—with the tide of immigration gaining in
momentum every year—the national affairs of this
earth provide no anticipation more assured than that
the present inhabitants of Central and Western Canada
are but the vanguard of a population which, within the
experience of persons now living, will be counted by
tens of millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most railways have come into existence merely to
serve a nation’s needs. It was, as we have seen, the
higher fate of the C.P.R. first to create the nation whose
needs it was to serve. Out of that fact sprang traditions
that have moulded the destiny and that conserve the
character of one of the most gigantic, most powerful,
most prosperous, and most public-spirited corporations
in the world. It is sometimes said that a joint stock
company has no soul to be saved and no hindquarters
to be kicked. Irreverent remarks of that sort do not
apply to the C.P.R. Those who have lived or travelled
in Canada will not need to be told about that remarkable
and unique institution. But the rest of the world are
not in a position to know, and certainly could never
guess, the rôle filled by that railway in a stirring
national drama. To the Bourses of Europe the C.P.R.
is only a triumphant corporation that makes a clear
annual profit of over £5,000,000, that is constantly and
successfully extending its enterprises, and that issues
to its proprietors at par new stock that commands a high
premium. But those facts merely reveal the C.P.R.
in its public character. Its domestic character is the
interesting study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The C.P.R. is the servant, friend, partner (and, I
had almost written, pal) of the settler in Central and
Western Canada. No soul, indeed! Why, of the
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
C.P.R.’s several titles to the world’s esteem, the first
place must be given to what I can only call its psychological
worth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the growing community of prosperous grain-growers
in Alberta was telling me the story of his early
experiences—how he arrived with his large family on
the land, and how he and his sons set to work and built
their house. “Yes,” I said, “but where did you and
your family live before the house was ready?” “Oh,”
he replied, “the C.P.R. very kindly lent us a shack to
be going on with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another settler, also reviewing his initial efforts,
explained that, being a muff at his new work, he failed
to make timely arrangements for harvesting his first
crop, which consequently was ruined. “Having counted
on the grain to see me through,” he added, “I was fairly
broke. But the good old C.P.R. came to my rescue.
They gave me work near my place and paid me well,
and next spring they lent me horses and fitted me out
with seed—in fact, they helped a lame dog over the
stile.” A third Canadian farmer had bought irrigated
land from the C.P.R. on the usual basis of easy annual
payments. “But,” he explained, “the minor canals had
not been completed in our neighbourhood, and water
did not reach my ditches until two months after I got
there. Having to run up to Calgary, I called in at the
C.P.R. and told them about it. They were most apologetic,
and said they were very much to blame, as the
land ought not to have been sold as irrigated land until
the water was actually there; so, quite of their own
accord, they gave me an extra year’s grace before my
first payment became due.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a conscientiousness about the C.P.R., a
thoughtfulness, a something that is downright human,
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
not to say kind-hearted. In travelling across the ocean
and the land you see the big things of the C.P.R.—its
magnificent liners, its palatial hotels, its superb feats
of engineering—but somehow the real greatness of the
company seems to lie in the little personal acts of
which I have given three examples. It is difficult to
find a definition that fits the C.P.R. To liken it to a
philanthropic society is out of the question; one cannot
associate the idea of philanthropy with an organisation
which, with its stock ranging well above 200 “on
Change,” distributes over £3,000,000 per annum in the
form of a 10-per-cent. dividend. The C.P.R. leaves
upon the mind an intangible impression of a paradoxical
character. It suggests a sort of Socialist Government
run by shareholders for profit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chatting with a puzzled C.P.R. officer, I tried to
make him realise how deeply a visitor from England
was impressed by the C.P.R. in its ethical—quite apart
from its engineering and financial—aspect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, don’t you see,” he argued, “that the C.P.R.
is directly interested in the success of every settler, and
that the greater his success the more grain and other
freight will he send over our line? Besides, the more
a man prospers out here, the more powerful is he as
a human magnet to attract friends and relatives from
the old country. Looked at from those points of view,
every new arrival is an important asset, and we have
to see to it that the asset matures. In other words, if
through inexperience or want of cash the settler meets
with difficulties at the outset of his career, we have a
definite interest in helping him through those difficulties.
As a matter of fact, in advancing money for
seed, etc., we run no appreciable financial risk, since
certain success awaits the Canadian farmer who sticks
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
to his work, provided he possesses the necessary modicum
of common sense. If he is any good at all, we
know he will get on all right, even if he does not know
that himself. Therefore I assure you the action of the
C.P.R. has a strictly business, not to say selfish, basis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, yes, I could see all that; but, still, the virtues
of the C.P.R. had not been explained away to my
satisfaction. Many transportation and other companies
have an interest in serving the public, but they act
within the limited sanction of prearranged routine, and
their servants are held in leash by red tape. I had never
before come across a capitalistic corporation which
offered a helping hand to anyone in need of it, dealing
with each case on its merits. I had never before encountered
a capitalistic corporation which, through its
thousand and one agents, acted in all matters with ungrudging
and anxious zeal. All along the broad tract
of country that it serves, the C.P.R. is a watchful,
ministering, unseen, personal force. It is actuated by
an almost paternal but wholly unobtrusive sense of
responsibility towards the country it has created and the
people that country contains. I might fill this chapter
with different examples of how interest is shown and
assistance rendered. I can even give an example that
is of purely personal application to myself. Last
autumn it became known to the C.P.R. that I, a visitor
from England, was laid up with a temporary indisposition
in a hotel at Gleichen, Alberta. The C.P.R.
wrote to say it was sorry! You may smile, gentle
reader, but such was the pleasant fact; nor am I prepared
to deny that the process of convalescence was
assisted by the knowledge that, in my short lapse from
health, I had the brotherly sympathy of an institution
that represented £80,000,000 of capital.
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Common sense scouts the idea that the C.P.R., in
the pains it takes to assist the farmers of the prairies
and the fruit-growers of British Columbia, is actuated
by a conscious desire for more freight (it already carries
113,000,000 bushels of grain per annum), or for more
passengers (of whom its yearly total has grown to
11,000,000—a figure, by the by, which, since it is larger
than the population of the Dominion, shows that many
Canadians travel frequently). Nay, the country having
now entered upon an era of rapid and automatic growth,
the prosperity of the C.P.R. is bound to increase, irrespective
of what may be called the fraternal side of its
activities. What is more, it has been shown to the satisfaction
of financial experts that even were the C.P.R.
divorced from its railroad, and the revenue derived therefrom,
it could continue to pay its 10 per cent. dividend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No; I am convinced that to explain the personal
services that the C.P.R. renders to the community, to
understand why the C.P.R. is a kind of joint stock
Government, we must hark back to the conditions that
fixed its traditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In its early days the C.P.R. had to face powerful
enemies, great difficulties, and the burden of anxiety
that is inevitable where heavy capital outlay has to
precede opportunity of remunerative revenue. Its
critics said the line could never pay. Its promoters
were supported only by their faith—their faith in a population
that had not yet arrived. Nowadays it is difficult
to realise that in 1885 men had still to be convinced
of the fertility of the western prairie. For centuries it
had yielded the world nothing but the furry coats of
the animals roaming its unpopulated wilds. Even amid
the strenuous work of constructing the line at high
pressure—with gangs of engineers, navvies and
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
station-builders forming a great graded army of men, accompanied
by thousands of horses, which pressed forward in
orderly sequence from section to section, each camp of
toilers working in an organised relation to the base of
supplies following them across the country—even at
that initial stage of its vast enterprise did the C.P.R.
begin studying the interests of the future settlers.
Special agricultural gangs were put on the construction
trains, and at intervals of about twenty miles they
alighted and ploughed a few acres, which were afterwards
seeded, with the result that, though the cultivation
was of the roughest, and no measures were taken
to keep marauding animals at bay, such heavy and
excellent crops were produced that the high potentialities
of soil and climate were triumphantly advertised.
Thus early did the C.P.R. “show the way” and identify
itself with the practical interests of settlers in the West.
It had land to sell them, it was providing them with
lines of communication, with means of transport. It
followed that the new population would be largely
dependent upon the railway. But the railway would be
wholly dependent upon the new population. Its
fortunes were contingent upon this one factor—whether
people should come and prosper and be satisfied. That
factor controlled the C.P.R.’s policy and established
its principles. For its rescue from the sea of financial
indebtedness could alone be effected by the settler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the extent of that indebtedness I have already
given some clues. Let me give a few more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 200-miles section along the north shore of Lake
Superior cost £2,400,000, a path having to be blasted
through granite and flint, in which process £420,000
worth of dynamite was used. At Pic River stone piers
had to be built to carry an iron truss bridge at an
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
elevation of one hundred and ten feet above the water
level. At Jackfish Bay three miles of winding track
were necessary to accomplish half a mile of progress,
the bridges, tunnels and galleries on that section costing
£300,000. In 1882 four thousand men, having
3,400 horses and 1,700 four-wheeled wagons, were at
work on the road, fixing rails, sleepers, spikes, fishplates
and bolts. In fifteen months 677 miles of main
track and 48 miles of sidings were constructed, ten
million cubic yards of earth being moved in the process.
Between Calgary and the Bow River Pass from two
to three miles of bridges had to be made. Between
Port Moody and Kamloops—213 miles—the engineers
had to cut twenty tunnels, representing a total length
of one mile and three-quarters, through granite and
crystalline limestone. In the mountain district of the
west the line had to reach a height of 5,321 feet above
sea level. Kicking Horse Pass presented engineering
problems which could only be successfully surmounted
by protracted toil; but British Columbia was impatient
for the railway, and so at that point a temporary section
was constructed which sacrificed the easy gradient elsewhere
secured, and for years afterwards several powerful
locomotives were required to pull each train up the
consequent “Big Hill.” That formidable incline has
since been superseded by an alternative section, costing
£300,000, and being seven miles of winding track,
which embraces two spiral tunnels through the mountain,
and two steel bridges (separated by only a few
hundred yards) over the Kicking Horse River, which,
by the way, is crossed nine times by the C.P.R., six
of the bridges being within a distance of twelve miles.
Another zig-zagging piece of work occurs in the Illecillewaet
Valley, where the line turns south, crosses a
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
high bridge and curves back almost to the starting-point,
but at a lower level, then forms another great
curve across a ravine, being 120 feet lower down on its
return, afterwards doubling upon itself and crossing
and recrossing the river; so that a spectator on one of
the neighbouring heights can see a sinuous railway
that reveals six tracks running almost parallel to one
another, each on a different level and each supported
largely by huge trestle bridges. Miles upon miles of
the line, where precipitous mountains are skirted, had
to be protected by timber corridors roofed at an angle
to deflect avalanches.</p>

<p class='caption'>ENCAMPMENT OF CHIEF MOSKOWEKUM OF THE CREE TRIBE</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Red Indians, not yet fully subdued, caused
some inconvenience to the constructors of the C.P.R.
Many of the imported navvies went in dread of the
painted braves, who were a little disposed to presume
on the fears they excited. Fortunately, the North-West
Mounted Police were in existence, and the historian of
that force, Mr. A. L. Haydon, has told us what
occurred.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> I give the following account of a typical
incident:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was in the early days of the C.P.R.’s progress
across the prairies that the Pie-a-Pot incident occurred.
Readers of Mrs. Steel’s stories may remember one
which tells how a Hindu fanatic squatted in the permanent
way of a new railway line in India and resisted
all efforts to dislodge him, until at length he was run
over and killed. The fanatic in question had a religious
motive for his defiant attitude. So much could hardly
be said of Pie-a-Pot the Cree, who took it upon himself
to play the same game. Pie-a-Pot and his band had
been giving no little trouble to the police about this
time. He and another chief named Long Lodge had
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
left their reserve and were wandering about the country
at large. This proceeding was contrary to the law,
and particularly so as their followers were all armed,
and had the reputation of being a turbulent crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened to bring Pie-a-Pot into sudden
collision with the police was this. Fetching up with
his band at last at a point some little distance ahead
of the railway line, he encamped. His tepees were put
up, the carts unloaded, the horses sent out on the
prairie to feed, and there was every indication that the
wanderers had found a choice spot from which they
did not intend to move. By and by the railway track
advanced closer towards them, and the contractors
looked askance at the Indian settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pie-a-Pot paid no attention to the oncoming army
of white men. He was there first; it was his chosen
location; let them shift him if they dared. The railway
authorities sent emissaries demanding his evacuation
of the spot; but Pie-a-Pot laughed at them, while
his ‘bucks’ rode excitedly about on their ponies and
fired off rifles at random, and shouted of what they
would do to the whites if it came to a fight. Matters
were at a deadlock. The railway men could not go
on so long as the Indian camp blocked the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the Lieutenant-Governor of the Territories was
appealed to, and ere long there came a despatch from
the North-West Mounted Police headquarters at Regina
to the little post at Maple Creek, much to this effect:
‘Please settle trouble; move on Indians.’ On receipt
of the message two men were at once detailed for the
task. One was a sergeant, the other was a constable.
With a written order to Chief Pie-a-Pot, an official notice
to quit, they rode out quietly to the camp and made
known their instructions.
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their arrival was a signal for a fresh outburst
on the part of the Indians. In their nomadic life the
members of this band had not yet, to put it literally,
run up against the law as personified by the North-West
Mounted Police. They knew them by reputation
to be firm, hard-dealing men whose hand was heavy
upon the wrong-doer, but they had no practical experience
from which to learn caution. So they surrounded
the two guardians of law and order, jeering
at them, backing their ponies into the police horses,
and otherwise trying to discompose them. The sergeant
and the constable, in their scarlet tunics, with the smart-looking
pill-box forage caps set at an angle on their
heads, meanwhile sat still, the former reading his order,
which was that Pie-a-Pot must break camp and take
the northward trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To this command the chief insolently refused to
listen. The sergeant pulled out his watch. ‘I will
give you fifteen minutes,’ he said calmly. ‘If by the
end of that time you haven’t begun to comply with the
order, we shall make you.’ The quarter of an hour
passed without any sign of a move being made. Pie-a-Pot
sat in front of his tent and smoked. Round him
and the policemen had gathered all the rest of the
tribe, ‘bucks,’ squaws and children, most of them yelling
abuse and urging on the bolder spirits among
them to still further exhibitions of defiance. The firing
of rifles almost in the faces of the red-coats was one
form of sport indulged in, but it was of no avail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Time’s up!’ said the sergeant, replacing his
watch in his pocket. Then that amazing man dismounted,
threw the reins of his horse to his companion,
and walked over to Pie-a-Pot’s tepee. One kick of his
foot at the key-pole and the painted buffalo-skin
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
covering collapsed. Ignoring the shrieks of the discomfited
squaws thereunder, and the threats of the men, the
sergeant proceeded through the camp, kicking out key-pole
after key-pole until all the tents had been overthrown.
‘Now git!’ was what he said—or might have
said, in the absence of any exact record of his utterances.
And it is some tribute to his sagacity that Pie-a-Pot
did so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not, it will be noted, any real fight left in
the Indians; but this could not be said of the allied
race, the Half-Breeds. They were at that time on the
eve of their rebellion; and it is interesting to note that
the C.P.R. was completed in time to be of service in
that affair. On May 18, 1885, the last rail was laid in
the line skirting Lake Superior, and the very next day
the Montreal artillery militia passed over that line on
their way to assist in suppressing the Riel rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And soon the procession of immigrants was moving
across the country, to quicken Manitoba and British
Columbia into vigorous growth and found the intermediate
provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. Then
the C.P.R. saw that its faith would be justified. A
beginning had been made in tapping the agricultural
and mineral riches of Western Canada. The railway
was the steel key that had unlocked a treasury of incalculable
wealth—wealth that poured forth, and continues
to pour forth, in a stream ever expanding with
the growth of population. Solicitude for the well-being
of new settlers became the bed-rock of C.P.R. policy.
On that basis, the company won its way to a prosperity
that was assisted by developments which, in their
magnitude and the foresight that inspired them, were
fitting sequels to the original enterprise. Early the
C.P.R. provided three steel steamships to traverse the
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
Great Lakes—craft since supplemented by magnificent
Clyde-built vessels. Later it made a new water connection,
with car ferries plying between Windsor, in
Ontario, and Detroit, in Michigan. Afterwards the
C.P.R. turned its attention to the lakes and rivers of
British Columbia; and to-day on those waters it controls
some twenty vessels, several of them of considerable
size and appointed with superb quarters for travellers.
Another fleet of twenty steamships carry passengers
and merchandise between ports on the coast of British
Columbia. But the C.P.R. has not been content
merely to navigate Canadian waters. Early it established
a trans-Pacific service connecting the Dominion
with China and Japan, the pioneer vessels being replaced
in 1891 by the famous <span class='it'>Empress of India</span> and her
sister ships, which established a new standard of comfort
in ocean travel. A later development was the
trans-Atlantic service, also furnished with superb liners,
and providing new means of communication between
Canada and Liverpool, London, Bristol and Antwerp.
Thus the C.P.R. has already extended its sphere of
operations two-thirds round the world; all that is needed
to complete the circle being a service of C.P.R. aeroplanes
across Europe and Asia. The company’s combined
fleets include sixty-seven steamships—a number
about equal to all the battleships of the United States,
Japan, France and Russia. The C.P.R. vessels,
placed end to end, would form a line three and a half
miles long. Between them they consume every day
2,903 tons of coal. Their crews and shore staffs form
an army of 11,294 men. They annually cover a mileage
equal to fifty-seven journeys round the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor, on the land, has the C.P.R. been content with
its three thousand miles of track stretching across the
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
continent. To-day it controls over eleven thousand
miles of railway, on which there are running 1,534 locomotives,
1,870 passenger cars and 48,850 freight and
cattle cars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides owning and working so many means of
communication, this amazing railway company has
endowed Canada with a chain of sixteen fine hotels, including
the famous Château Frontenac at Quebec—a
stately structure that cost £600,000 and has accommodation
for a thousand guests; the Royal Alexandra, at
Winnipeg, which, like the hotel at Vancouver, yields
a yearly profit of £12,000; the Empress, at Victoria,
which annually puts £14,000 into the coffers of the
company; and the luxurious hotels, fitted with exquisite
taste, at Lake Louise, Banff, and other health resorts
in the mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one thing that the C.P.R. does not do—it
does not go in for farming. It might do so. It has
enough land to carry on farming operations upon a
scale commensurate with its other affairs, and to the
tune of an annual profit that could not fall far short
of £10,000,000. Providing and organising the necessary
labour would constitute a difficulty (because, in
a country where everybody can secure his own freehold,
and grow prosperous in cultivating it, no one is content
long to till the soil for an employer, let the wages
be never so high). Still, the history of the C.P.R.
affords abundant proof that it is not to be baulked by
a difficulty; and therefore we must look in another
direction for the reason why the C.P.R. does not farm,
and probably has never so much as thought of doing so.
Such action would be contrary to the purpose, policy
and principles on which the fortunes of the C.P.R.
have been founded. It is there to assist, not to
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
compete with, the population. It sells its land. The
quantity it sold last year was 975,030 acres, at an average
price of £2 13s. 3d. per acre—an average price,
by the way, that leaves out of account the irrigated
land, of which 145,421 acres were sold, at £5 10s. 9½d.
per acre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mention of the irrigated land prompts some reference
to an undertaking which, while sufficiently interesting
on its own merits, serves as an excellent illustration
of the enterprising spirit in which the C.P.R. promotes
the welfare of Western Canada and its people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Part of the territory that came into the possession
of the company was a stretch of land—between Calgary
and a point some thirty miles west of Medicine Hat—which,
while its capacity to produce bumper crops had
been demonstrated, was liable in certain seasons to
suffer from an inadequate rainfall. And since an occasional
loss of crop is apt to have a demoralising effect,
more particularly on new settlers who have not had time
to accumulate a financial reserve, the C.P.R. decided
that, before putting those 3,000,000 acres on the
market, it would counteract the natural shortcoming,
and ensure the agriculturist against loss, by carrying
out a system of irrigation. For this purpose the area
was divided into three sections—a Western Section, a
Central Section and an Eastern Section. The Western
Section was put in hand first, and, at an expenditure of
over £1,000,000, the C.P.R. tapped the Bow River
with a canal seventeen miles long, and of a width
that varied from 60 feet at the bottom to 120 feet at
the water level; it constructed a reservoir three miles
long, half a mile wide and 40 feet deep; and it excavated
1,600 miles of primary and secondary canals
(the former being 120 feet wide by 10 feet deep) and
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
distributing ditches. These extensive works, involving
the removal of more than 8,000,000 tons of
earth, necessarily occupied some years; and thus, long
before the canals and ditches had reached their limits,
the artificial water supply had been tested for a season
or so on parts of the area that were dealt with first.
That early experience was conclusive; and the land was
eagerly taken up. Now the C.P.R. have commenced
to irrigate the Eastern Section—an area of 1,100,000
acres—and the work, which will occupy about three
years, is estimated to cost £1,700,000. In this case
heavier expenditure is necessitated by a greater difficulty
in reaching the source of supply, and 3,500 miles of
canals and ditches have to be constructed. Afterwards
the Central Section will be put in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On visiting a number of irrigated farms in the
Western Section, I found their prosperous proprietors
enthusiastic in praise of artificial watering, of which,
indeed, the fruits were visible. Not that an abundant
harvest is the only advantage yielded by the system.
In the glorious Canadian sunshine, herbage is liable to
become so dry that a chance spark will set it on fire; and
farmers bore grateful testimony that, when this has
befallen, the opening of an irrigation ditch proved an
easy means of arresting the trouble. Again, food fishes
are swept down the excavated waterways; and many
an agriculturist, on discovering trout and pike flopping
about in his furrows, has found himself with a
strengthened faith in the wisdom of the C.P.R.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor must I omit to mention a new style of colonisation
that has been devised and introduced by this
inventive and indefatigable company. Hitherto, in the
history of Canada and other new countries, the rule
has been for a settler to arrive on empty land, and find
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
himself compelled to build a habitation, dig a well,
knock up outhouses and erect fencing before he can
address himself to the crucial matter of cultivating the
soil. In a flash of inspiration, it occurred to the C.P.R.
that this awkward and irksome beginning of the new
life is not inevitable; and that, before offering land for
sale, they might just as well put the required buildings
and appurtenances upon it, so that the new-comer who
buys it shall be spared protracted initial labours for
which, in all probability, he lacks the necessary training.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This novel idea grew and blossomed. The C.P.R.
fenced off a number of holdings, and upon each built a
neat little home, with a living-room, sleeping apartments,
and a kitchen fitted with a large cooking stove.
On each homestead it also built stabling and a barn,
provided a source of drinking water, and set up fences.
Nor did the C.P.R. stop there. In each case it
ploughed forty acres of the land, and, in the following
spring, seeded them. It thus prepared a group of
“Ready-made Farms”—to quote the name bestowed
upon these remarkable innovations in the domain of
colonisation. They were offered on the C.P.R.’s usual
terms of payment by instalments—the first of twelve
annual instalments to be due after the first crop was
harvested. It was merely stipulated that each family
should possess at least £200, to carry them over the
initial stage of their new existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arriving stream of Canada’s immigrants—or,
rather, the assembling army of Great Britain’s emigrants—provided
many competitors for these new
opportunities. I do not know whether the C.P.R.
made a selection from among those competitors, or
whether it accepted the earliest applicants. But, having
visited last autumn the first group of Ready-made
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
Farms to be occupied, I can testify that the hundred
new neighbours, whether chosen by chance or discrimination,
looked to be the sort of energetic and
enthusiastic men who could be trusted to profit by the
favours of fate. Those farmers (who, for the most
part, followed other callings in the old country) had
found their first crops in vigorous growth; and when
I arrived they were largely occupied—with powerful
machinery bought by the communal purse—in enlarging
their areas of cultivation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in this connection I cannot forbear to mention
a visit I paid, in that district, to one of the C.P.R.
experimental farms. There I found an enthusiastic
professor of agriculture, whose duty it was not only
to test various grains and roots under local conditions
of soil and climate, but to place his knowledge at the
disposal of C.P.R. settlers who were in doubt or difficulty.
During my brief stay several inquirers were
attended to, their problems ranging from how potatoes
should be stored to where a couple of good horses
could promptly be purchased. Meanwhile, the professor’s
buggy was waiting at the gate, and it seemed
he was due to depart on a round of visits to farmers
who, as I gathered, wanted to be shown how they
could use their land to greatest advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus this great corporation, originally and nominally
a railway company, has brought nation-building
to an art and a science.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, I cannot refrain from mentioning two incidents
that gave me personal peeps at the internal
working of the C.P.R. Standing one Sunday afternoon
on the crowded platform of Moose Jaw railway
station, I witnessed the arrival of a train which, since
no passengers were allowed to enter it, was easy to
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
identify as a “special.” It held my attention for another
reason. From an office on the permanent way there
issued a squad of men clad in white overalls, immaculately
clean, each with a bright little nosegay pinned
to his breast. Some carried short ladders, others held
pails, and each was armed with either a mop or a
swab. Thus variously burdened, they ran with smiling
faces to the train, and in a twinkling their many
hands were busy on its exposed surfaces. Nor had two
minutes passed before those dirty and travel-stained
cars were aglow with polished panels, bright windows
and shimmering brass. As the train moved out of the
station I caught sight of a military looking figure
standing in the gangway at the rear, his face alight
with gratification. It was all a profound mystery
to me until I sought explanations from one of the festive
grooms, as he stood to recover breath after his late
exertions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he proudly panted, “that was Sir Thomas
Shaughnessy, president of our road! I guess we sort
of give him a surprise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few months later I had occasion to visit the headquarters
of the C.P.R. at Montreal; and, reaching an
upper story of the great building, I found myself
in the outer lobby of the directors’ department. It
was, as luck would have it, a Saturday afternoon, and
therefore I feared to find the place deserted even by
such minor authority as could deal with my unimportant
business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everyone gone?” echoed the astonished office boy.
“You bet your life they haven’t. The president’s
in there”—indicating an office with his thumb.
“There’s a vice-president in here”—again pointing—“and
another vice-president over there”—directing my
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
attention to yet a third door. “They’re mighty busy.
Who d’you want to see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having satisfied his curiosity on that point, I ventured
to remark that they were working late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Late!” he protested. “It ain’t late. Why,
they’ll be here till eight or nine to-night—Sir Thomas
and the rest of ’em. And me, too! There’s always
a lot to do on Saturdays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few words I told him of the week-end institution
that had taken deep root in business circles on
British soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wouldn’t suit us,” declared the C.P.R. office
boy emphatically. “What! Go off pleasuring when
there’s work to be done? Not likely!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span><h1 id='t5059'>CHAPTER X<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE NEW HUDSON BAY ROUTE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In the preceding chapter I showed how a huge stretch
of Western Canada was opened up to civilisation and
settlement by a railway. Another momentous development
within the Dominion is about to occur. I refer
to the project (now in hand) for constructing a railroad
that will link Winnipeg with Port Nelson, on the
western shore of Hudson Bay, and so give Central
Canada a seaport—a seaport open seven months in
the year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 397 miles of rails that remain to be laid will
provide a shorter and cheaper route between the prairie
provinces and Europe. In mere distance, the journey
from the Manitoba capital to Liverpool will be reduced
by about 900 miles. But that fact indicates the least
part of the boon that is promised to commerce. The
cost of carriage by land is considerably higher than
the cost of carriage by water; and along the new route
grain from Winnipeg will reach the steamship after a
railway journey of 582 miles, instead of, as at present,
a railway journey of either 1,422 or 1,904 miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the new line is chiefly important for a reason
apart from the reduction in freight and the revolution
in trade which it is likely to effect. That line will
unlock a new territorial treasury of natural resources,
and open to the settler a region (known now as
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
Keewatin) much larger than the Province of Manitoba.
It will, moreover, be the first stage in the development
of Northern Canada—those wonderful realms of long
days which I am convinced are destined, by reason of
their high agricultural potentialities, to strike the
imagination of the world with the force of a great
geographical revelation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, then, and in certain subsequent chapters of
this book, I definitely pass from one phase of my
subject to the other. Yet, since forecasts are vain
unless supported by facts, I shall make Canada of
“To-day” throw light on Canada of “To-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Things heard and things seen—just a stray fact or
two—awakened my curiosity, and I went from end
to end of the Dominion in a spirit of inquiry. Calling
on all the provincial governments in the West, I
pointed my finger to blank spaces on the map and
asked: “What do you know about them?” This led
to some significant experiences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In British Columbia came the astonished reply:
“Well, of course, there are people up in the Yukon—just
here and there—mining. And gold, coal and
copper mines are scattered about this province. More
than that we know nothing, except that explorers have
testified, concerning nearly every region they have
visited, that the country is rich in fine timber and
minerals. As for possessing any definite knowledge
of central and northern British Columbia—why, sir,
we still have only the most imperfect and superficial
knowledge of this southern part. The other day I was
over in Vancouver, and I went on the inaugural trip
along a new railway running a few miles out of the
city. Many of the leading citizens of Vancouver were
in the cars, and there they were exclaiming in
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
astonishment over a beautiful district that they had never
dreamt was so near their doors!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Edmonton, the minister I interviewed jumped
from his seat when he heard my inquiry, and, striding
across his office, eagerly unrolled a huge map of his
province. “Look!” he cried, as his hand swept over
the bulk of the area. “That is all a sealed book to
us. We know generally that it has a splendid climate,
and that millions upon millions of acres are underlain
with coal. But the whole of that country is unsurveyed,
and practically the whole of it is unprospected and unexplored.
You want to know about that land? Ah!
and so do we. The Government wants very much to
know about it. No doubt a lot of valuable data is
in existence, if only it could be collected and collated.
I mean the experiences of isolated missionaries, pioneer
settlers and so on. People talk about Alberta as
though it were a settled country! I have often seen
Edmonton referred to as being in Northern Alberta!
So no wonder you are surprised to find the Government
with blank minds about half the territory under their
authority. Look! The settlement north of Edmonton
is still below the middle of the province. The whole
of the northern part may be described as a practically
unknown country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the same in Saskatchewan and Manitoba—the
governments were eager to secure the very information
I asked them to impart. But at the four capitals
I received hints as to quarters in which reliable knowledge
might be looked for. The result was that I
interviewed several explorers, besides discovering, at
Ottawa, a veritable mine of information about the great
north lands. For the Federal Government and its chief
geographer (Mr. R. E. Young) had preceded me in
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
this search for obscure knowledge. A special committee,
it seemed, had assembled, interviewed and cross-examined
the handful of men who could speak from
personal knowledge about the empty spaces on the
map of Canada. Their evidence was placed at my
disposal; and to that source I am largely indebted for
the information in this chapter, and in those dealing
with “New Saskatchewan” and “Northern Alberta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Mr. J. Burr Tyrrell, the well-known
mining engineer, who was in the Government Geological
Service from 1883 to 1898, “I spent nine or
ten years in the country to the west and south-west of
Hudson Bay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think well of agricultural possibilities
there?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly,” said Mr. Tyrrell. “You may take
Canada as a whole, and say that north of the present
settled region there is a broad belt of several hundred
miles that will be good for farming. It carries immense
quantities of valuable timber. Beyond that belt is a
great region which will yield valuable minerals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now let me reproduce Mr. Tyrrell’s specific
testimony concerning the region that will be opened up
by the Hudson Bay Railway. He indicated a line running
north-west from Churchill, and pointed out that
the country north of that line is outside the farmer’s
scope. South of the line there is a belt of from one
to two hundred miles in width, which is sparsely
wooded, having trees along the banks of streams and
in sheltered positions. In this belt there are areas that
would support a northern vegetation, but it is not, in
his opinion, eminently suited for agriculture, there
being but little decomposed soil there except in the
valleys. South of that belt is a forest region, about
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
two hundred miles wide, lying west of the Nelson
River and extending along the Churchill River right
away to the Mackenzie and Athabasca rivers. It is for
the most part excellent agricultural land—as fine as can
be found in the North-West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everywhere,” said Mr. Tyrrell, “I found abundant
evidence of rich vegetation, and wherever agriculture
or horticulture had been attempted within the forest
belt it had been eminently successful. I have seen
growing in that country potatoes—and most excellent
ones they were—carrots, turnips, cabbages, cauliflowers
and all the ordinary garden produce that grows in
Ontario. Indeed, the land there is similar to the
Ontario land, and on it can be raised practically everything
that can be raised in that province, if we leave
the Niagara peninsula out of account. The summer
is warm, and there is a good rainfall. The winter does
not count, because things do not grow in the winter.
A small part of the district is park country, half
wooded. The belt is a continuation northward of the
settled Saskatchewan country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the specified area (through which the greater
part of the new railway will pass) it appears that the
Indians, when hunting in the spring, plant little patches
of potatoes here and there, and return in the autumn
to dig them for use in the winter. “On several occasions,”
said Mr. Tyrrell, “I have gone out and dug
a pail of beautiful potatoes from those little Indian
gardens buried in the woods. They have received no
hoeing, or any other sort of cultivation, from the time
of planting to the time of digging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Tyrrell has no doubt that the country in
question will support quite a thick population; and he
mentioned that, south of the forest belt, and north
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
of Lake Winnipeg (in other words, the region to be
traversed by southern sections of the Hudson Bay
Railway), “there is another magnificent area, from five
to ten thousand square miles in extent, and as fine a
country as is to be found in Manitoba or anywhere else.
That area extends westward along the Churchill.
These lands to the north of Lake Winnipeg are an
extension of the same basin as the Manitoba clays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me now call another witness—Mr. A. P. Low,
Deputy-Minister of Mines in the Federal Government,
and, as an earlier chapter has borne witness, formerly
a prominent member of the Geological Survey. In that
capacity Mr. Low pursued some explorations in
Keewatin, with the result that he is able to make the
following contributions to our knowledge of this undeveloped
region:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between Norway House (which is north of Lake
Winnipeg) and Hudson Bay the country is not very
elevated, the highest points being probably about 1,000
feet above sea level. For about half the distance to
the bay the traveller passes over a rolling plain, the
rocks being ancient formations of the Laurentian and
Huronian age, while farther on there is a deposit of
limestone and sandstone. On the first half of the
journey from Norway House to Churchill the country
slopes very gently towards the bay, the grade being
not more than eight or ten feet to the mile, if it be
that. The north-eastern part of the country is practically
a plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Low pointed out that considerable areas of
swampy land exist. The rivers have thrown up banks,
and there is only an occasional break in those banks to
serve for drainage. In many places the river banks are
from five to ten feet higher than the adjoining land,
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
which consequently is more or less drowned for a distance
often extending back as far as one can walk in
a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He considers that probably half the country due
east from Norway House—say for one hundred miles—would
be fit for agriculture. There are, of course, very
few settlements in there at present, and the only one
Mr. Low visited was a Hudson Bay post at Trout
Lake. There he found peas, potatoes and other garden
crops growing and looking well. That no appreciable
trouble occurred from summer frosts was shown by
the condition of the green peas. Apparently, indeed,
the climate is quite favourable for hardy crops. The
soil areas fit for agriculture are fairly large, rocky hills
occurring only at intervals; and he has no doubt that
quite a large region will be available for future settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the plain south-east of Nelson River,
Mr. Low said it appears to be muskeg and spruce land
rather than a hay area. He does not regard that low-lying
country around Hudson Bay as of first-class
agricultural value in its present form; but it shows a
fair amount of vegetable growth, the subsoil is largely
clay, and with some drainage, he thinks, a great deal of
it will be good for farming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another influential witness is Mr. D. B. Dowling,
of the Geological Survey. Speaking from personal
knowledge of the region to be traversed by the railroad,
Mr. Dowling threw light on the strips of raised land
running beside the rivers. He said they represent a
mile, or less than a mile, of well-made country covered
by fine forests. “The centre portion between the
streams,” he added, “is now exactly as it was when
it first came from the sea, except that it has some
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
vegetation on it which it had not at that time. All it
needs is drainage. The soil and climate are good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this crucial matter of farming prospects in the
country to be opened up, the personal experience of
two other members of the Geological Survey is available.
I refer to Mr. Owen O’Sullivan and Mr. William
McInnes. Mr. O’Sullivan, in 1904, was engaged in
studying the west coast of James Bay, and in the
summer of 1906 he started from Split Lake, on
the Nelson, and went down the Little Churchill to the
Big Churchill. The land about Big Lake, he said,
is a good loamy soil, but from Big Lake to the Big
Churchill the country is rocky and swampy, though
with a good deal of rich clay loam in places. Mr.
O’Sullivan was able to testify that very tasty potatoes
are grown at Split Lake. In the month of June he ate
some that had been grown during the previous year.
He saw turnips, cabbage and lettuce growing, and they
appeared to be very good. The potatoes were taken up
on August 23rd and 25th. Some left in the ground
had the tops touched pretty severely by frost in
September. On being asked about the land near the
head of Lake Winnipeg, Mr. O’Sullivan said he never
tasted better potatoes than some that were grown at
Cross Lake. Concerning a point far to the north of the
terminus of the new line, this explorer had an interesting
piece of information to impart. He saw
lettuce and turnips growing at Churchill, and he is
of opinion that potatoes, with proper attention, would
mature there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Special interest attaches to the experience of Mr.
McInnes, because he zig-zagged across the actual
ground to be crossed by the first half of the Hudson
Bay Railway. The whole region from Split Lake to
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
the Saskatchewan is, he said, a clay-covered country.
In traversing that country he went by way of the
Burntwood River and returned by way of the Grassy
River, making a number of excursions between those
two boundaries. After leaving Split Lake, he found
the clay-covered country absolutely free from boulders
and gravel. Even on the shores of the lakes, unless
a height of about 800 feet were reached, no gravel
bars were met with. “There is absolutely nothing to
interfere with the cultivation of the soil,” testified Mr.
McInnes. “The country has been repeatedly burnt
over, and it is covered by a very open forest. Grasses
grow fairly luxuriantly there, the blue joint grass and
a wild rye being the prevailing species. I understand
that these are a good meadow growth and make excellent
fodder. While there in June, July and August
I saw grass growing to a height of from eighteen inches
to two feet.” Asked to indicate the extent of the
country he was describing, Mr. McInnes computed it
at about 10,000 square miles, adding that he did not
mean to say the whole of that area was good agricultural
land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This explorer’s testimony will enable the reader,
without consulting a map, to have a definite idea of
the nature of the land along the new route. The Pas,
on the Saskatchewan River, to the north-west of Lake
Winnipegosis, may be taken as the starting-point of
the line, since a railway to that place has for some
time been constructed as part of the Canadian Northern
system. Setting out from the Pas, and proceeding
towards Nelson, Mr. McInnes passed through about
140 miles of country underlain by the flat limestone
of northern Manitoba. He walked for miles over bare
hills that carried hardly any soil. Then he entered
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
the clay belt previously mentioned. The railway, he
explained, would traverse about 170 miles of those
clay lands before it reached Split Lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. McInnes pointed out that on the Nelson River
wheat has been grown successfully at Norway House
and at Cross Lake. The Hudson Bay people do not
raise wheat at their posts nowadays, but formerly they
grew it and ground it in hand-mills. He saw potatoes
that had been produced fifty miles north of the Pas,
and they were great showy specimens such as one sees at
exhibitions. On July 11th, when Mr. McInnes arrived
at Nelson, potatoes planted by the Indians had tops
eleven inches high and almost ready to flower. When
he returned to the Pas, on September 6th, he found
the Indian corn there was very well headed out, with
large, fine ears quite ready for table use. He stayed
at the Pas until September 29th, by which time the
locality had not been visited by frost. “With eighteen
hours of daylight, and no frost in the summer,” Mr.
McInnes said, “vegetation is rapid; and in a country
where you can grow Indian corn, you can grow practically
anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the reader will probably have gathered, within
the large territory to be traversed by the line there
are four old posts at which missionaries and Hudson
Bay people would be likely to have had instructive
agricultural experience. I refer to Norway House,
which, as already mentioned, lies to the north of Lake
Winnipeg; Cross Lake post, which is north of Norway
House; Cumberland House, which is north-west of
the Pas; and Nelson House, which is east of the new
line, at a point rather less than midway between the
Pas and Port Nelson. Sir John Richardson bore
witness in 1820 that wheat was successfully raised at
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
Cumberland House. Speaking of Nelson House, the
Rev. J. Semmens has said: “In my experience wheat
is not a sure crop there. All depends upon the season.
Oats and barley will do well any time.” The evidence
of the Rev. Dr. John McDougall is also available. He
said: “The district in which are situated Norway
House, Cross Lake, Oxford House, Island Lake,
Nelson House and Split Lake covers a wide area, and
at each of these places garden vegetables and grain for
personal requirements have been successfully grown
for a number of years. Summer frosts are practically
unknown, and the germination of vegetation, owing to
the long hours of sunshine, is exceedingly rapid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That must conclude my summary of evidence tending
to show that farming will flourish in the new region
to be opened up. On other vital points I shall put
some of the foregoing authorities again into the witness-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is general agreement that the country possesses
considerable timber wealth. Speaking of the
region between Norway House and Hudson Bay, Mr.
Low said the forests, as in so many parts of Canada,
have been largely destroyed by fire, but around some
of the large lakes, on their islands, and in other places
a fine growth of timber is found, with white and black
spruce pine, aspen poplar, and white birch running
to eighteen inches in diameter. This is what Mr.
Dowling said: “There is a strip all along the front of
the bay which has no trees. Back in the interior there
is timber. Along the river valleys the trees are always
well grown.” Mr. O’Sullivan explained that the
spruce and poplars in the valleys are sometimes twenty
inches in diameter, and that the cottonwood grows to
about fourteen inches in diameter. Speaking of the
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
country generally, Mr. McInnes said there is a great
deal of timber that would be fit for wood-pulp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the country’s wealth of fish and game, the
testimony is less qualified. Mr. Low mentioned that
the inland waters of Keewatin would yield a tolerable
abundance of whitefish, lake trout and other species,
and he said that in Hudson Bay the Indians net a
number of whitefish and ordinary river trout which
have developed sea-going habits. From the same
source we learn that along the east and north-west
shores of Hudson Bay the excellent and beautifully
coloured Arctic salmon is found. Mr. Low mentioned
that black, silver and grey foxes are taken in the
northern part of Keewatin, and they, with the beaver,
the otter and the marten represent the principal furs
of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Mr. Dowling we hear that the rivers of
Keewatin abound with perch, dory and jackfish, while
some of the larger streams contain sturgeon. He saw
five bears, and testified that it is a great country for
foxes, “which seem to be able to live on the sea-birds
and mice.” Mr. O’Sullivan, after mentioning that
sturgeon occur all through the Little Churchill River,
and that some of them weigh forty pounds, added:
“At Churchill you get the porpoise, which is quite
an item when you have to keep dogs for the winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. McInnes found two companies turning to commercial
account the fish of the lakes occurring within
a convenient distance from the Saskatchewan. “Going
out,” he said, “our party was short of pork and stopped
to get supplies. In one night’s fishing the Indians
caught so many sturgeon that we had enough to carry
us for 150 miles, to the Hudson Bay post. One of the
sturgeon was three feet long.” Ducks, he said, were
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
fairly plentiful, and so were wild geese, “which live
on all sorts of little shell-fish, water-beetles and crabs,
besides the seeds of many water plants other than wild
rice. I shot mallards in that country,” he went on
to say, “and their crops were full of little bivalve shells
about the size of my nail.” This was Mr. Tyrrell’s
impressive testimony: “Some of the small, shallower
lakes contain whitefish in enormous numbers. While
paddling along in a canoe I have seen the fins of thousands
sticking up out of the water.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;. There are all
the fish the lakes will hold—they are as full as the
water can supply food for them.” Mr. Tyrrell came
across great herds of cariboo in the far north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, through the eyes of those who have been
there, we will glance at the mineral possibilities of the
new country. Mr. Low pointed out that between
Chesterfield and Fullerton there are several fairly good
deposits of iron pyrites, and that some of these contain
small deposits of gold, which, he mentioned, was also
found by Dr. Wright somewhere in Whitcher Inlet.
On the same authority we learn that “the general character
of the southern part of Keewatin as regards
mineral resources is good.” Mr. Dowling, however,
inclined to the opinion that the country is not rich in
minerals. But incidentally he observed: “There is
iron ore, and the possibility of gold and silver ore,
and also copper ores in the Grass River district. There
is no asbestos. With reference to mica, it can be
found all over the country, but in small pieces.” Mr.
McInnes explained that, north of the Saskatchewan, he
crossed forty miles of limestone that would be excellent
for building purposes. On the Upper Winisk
River he discovered a large area of so-called norite rock.
That is the rock in which the nickel of Sudbury occurs.
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
He examined samples under the microscope, and said
the Keewatin formation is not to be distinguished from
the Ontario formation. Mr. McInnes also found—this
time at Cross Lake—an “area of Keewatin rocks, cut
by intrusive granite, of the same character as the
photogene of Western Ontario, which is almost always
gold-bearing.” Mr. Tyrrell recognises great possibilities
in the rocks of Keewatin, and he looks for “a
large development at some time” in the copper industry
between Chesterfield Inlet and the Copper Mine River.
He said that “the Eskimos pick up native copper and
make their implements from it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, one would think, is a very valuable clue. Mr.
Tyrrell showed me a large specimen of native copper
that he had obtained from an Eskimo hunter. This
eminent geologist saw gold and copper in rocks near
Chesterfield Inlet, and he has “every confidence” that
those rocks will produce workable ores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now I will finally recall the foregoing witnesses,
in order that they may say what opinions they formed
with reference to the climate of Keewatin. Mr. Low
considered “the summer as equal to that of Saskatchewan.”
“At Churchill,” said Mr. Dowling, “we had
winds from the south-west practically all through the
summer, and that made it very warm; but there were
two days when the wind came from the north, and
people wanted their overcoats at once.” From Mr.
McInnes came the statement that “the country averages
from four to five degrees in the summer months higher
temperature than is found at the same latitude farther
west.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speaking of the arable belt that is two hundred
miles wide, Mr. Tyrrell said there is little or no summer
frost there. At Nelson, gardening commences, he
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
understood, at the end of May, and frost does not appear
until about September 20th. He went on to make the
following useful statement: “People must not suppose
that vegetation is affected by the isothermal line, which
merely connects points that have the same annual mean
temperature. As things do not grow in the winter, the
winter temperature has nothing to do with farming possibilities.
The summer temperature is the only temperature
that counts for growth in the northern country.
As between two places in different latitudes, you have
to take into consideration the length of the day and
the amount of sunlight. Where the days have eighteen
hours’ sun a plant will grow faster than where the days
have only fourteen hours’ sun.” And again: “The
large body of water in Hudson Bay and James Bay
has an equalising effect on the winter temperature of
the surrounding country, tending to make the summers
cooler and the winters milder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, I think, the evidence is abundant that, when
trains run between Winnipeg and Hudson Bay, one
section of the Great North Lands, emerging from the
mists of obscurity and misapprehension, will take its
place among the most productive and habitable regions
of the British Empire.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span><h1 id='t5604'>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>EXPERIENCES OF IMMIGRANTS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Readers of this book will, I hope, include many persons
who think of emigrating to Canada; and fain would I
answer the question uppermost in their minds. “What
experiences await us there?” they will be anxious to
learn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have interviewed many settlers in the various
provinces, and their testimony admits of being focused
into three statements of well-nigh universal application—of
application, indeed, to all save persons who are
exceptionally lucky or exceptionally stupid. These
three statements are: (1) Life in Canada involves work,
and hard work. (2) The first year, and perhaps the first
two years, will be a time of stress and of struggling
with difficulties. (3) Then there comes the “turning of
the corner,” with assured prosperity to follow as the
result of continued effort. Nothing, indeed, is more
sure than that, in Canada, work commands an ample
reward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But my three generalities, after all, leave all the
details unstated; and I cannot fill in those details more
convincingly than by reproducing the actual personal
experiences, as chronicled almost from day to day, of
a typical English family who settled in Canada. But
the story of what befell Mr. and Mrs. Rendall must be
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
preceded by a word of explanation. They were members
of the large party who, in the spring of 1903,
emigrated under the auspices of the Rev. I. M. Barr—a
party whose affairs were destined to attract some
attention from the English Press by reason of special
difficulties involved in an isolated location. Nowadays
plenty of free land can be found within twenty miles
of a railway; but the Barr colonists were destined to
begin their new lives in a situation far more remote
from means of quick transportation. Thus, if Mr. and
Mrs. Rendall were typical English immigrants, their
early experiences give an exaggerated impression of
what the average settler has to expect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With my family,” Mr. Rendall wrote, “I left
England on April 8th, 1903, on the <span class='it'>Lake Simcoe</span>, as I
was unable to settle up my affairs in time to join the
Barr party on the <span class='it'>Manitoba</span>. I may say that I had
been a farmer in the Old Country all my life. The place
I rented in Devonshire had been farmed by my forefathers
for over two hundred years. I was paying rent
at the rate of over £2 an acre, in addition to rates,
tithe, taxes, and wages. A crisis came. The landlord
would not reduce the rent or do any repairs to the
dwelling-house or out-buildings, all of which were
falling into ruin; so I determined to throw up the life
of slaving for others and strike for independence in
Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having obtained from head-quarters all necessary
information respecting free-grant lands in the North-West,
I applied for a homestead for myself, and
another for one of my men, Barnes, who had determined
to throw in his lot with mine. Then, with my
wife and two children (aged two and four), I left the
Old Country, with many a heartache at parting, yet with
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
a strong determination to face all difficulties, and to
succeed in the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We left Liverpool on April 8th, and arrived at
St. John’s on April 13th,” records the husband succinctly.
In the lady’s diary the voyage received more
attention. “A gentleman slipped over the stairs leading
to the cabin,” she notes, “and broke his leg. There
was a birth on board; and a foreigner in the steerage
cut his throat, and is not expected to live. In addition
to all this, they have discovered no less than twenty
stowaways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Devonshire family lost no time in proceeding
by rail to Saskatoon, where they found the other Barr
colonists in a large temporary encampment. “I made
my own independent arrangements,” Mr. Rendall
wrote, “and took a room for my wife and children.
We reached Saskatoon on April 15th, and stayed there
till April 29th. My first business was to purchase a
wagon and pair of horses with harness. This meant
spending $508, a stiff outlay, but a necessary one. I
also bought a camp stove, a plough, harrows, and a
good supply of nails and tools. Having packed up our
traps, we set off to drive to Battleford. We had duly
provisioned ourselves for the journey, which was fortunate,
as, contrary to what we had been told, it proved
impossible to get anything on the road—a condition of
affairs that caused much misery and privation to many
of the poor colonists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My experience of horse-driving in the Old Country
stood me in good stead, and in spite of all difficulties,
including inclement weather and rough country, we
reached Battleford safe and sound, without one mishap,
in four and a half days. This was considered very
good, and I had a heavy load.
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“We remained at Battleford from May 2nd to
May 4th, when we resumed our progress to the
promised land. This part of the journey was the most
trying, with the road terribly rough and the weather
bitter. Had it not been for the Government tents,
which were set up at appointed stopping-places along
the route, many must have died from cold and hunger.
My wife and little girl felt the effects of exposure, and
by the time we reached the settlement both were
thoroughly ill. In fact, we were all worn out from
our long journey and the want of rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My first inquiry was for a doctor, who quickly
came to our assistance, and of whose kindness I cannot
speak too highly. With care, my wife and little one
soon recovered. Then my man went down with
threatened pneumonia, though the prompt attentions
of Dr. Amos saved him from a serious illness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here it will be interesting to recapitulate, from
the lady’s point of view, the experiences just briefly
narrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under date Friday, April 24th, I read in her diary:
“We have now been in Saskatoon since Wednesday
evening, and are busy getting all in readiness to trek
up to the settlement. We have overtaken Mr. Barr
and his party. They are in a huge camp, but the
children and I and my husband are in a room. Yesterday
I was greatly pleased to see my husband and our
fellow-traveller and friend, Mr. Young, come in with
smiling faces to say they had secured a splendid pair
of horses and a wagon. These are ours, as Mr. Young
is not purchasing yet. The children and I went in the
afternoon to see our new possessions. The horses are
really beautiful animals, strong, powerful, good-looking,
in fine condition, and well educated. There is
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
a large covered hood to the wagon, so it will serve as
a house for a while. The next bit of good news is
that we have had our land allotted to us.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sunday, May 2nd. Four and a half days’ trekking
through most perilous country! Some of the dykes
we had to pass over were simply awful. Very few got
through the journey without serious loss of baggage
and horses. I have a fair amount of courage, but it
has been taxed to the uttermost during the past few
days. The children have been most plucky. The
natives here think my husband and Barnes have done
splendidly to bring us through so well and free of all
mishaps. It has been bitterly cold camping out some
nights—two degrees below freezing. Still, we are alive,
and contemplate continuing our journey to the settlement
to-morrow—another seventy miles. We have our
camp stove, and we start and end our day with a good
foundation of porridge, which we find a splendid thing
to keep us warm and satisfied. This morning I rushed
first thing to the post office, but experienced a bitter
disappointment. Not one letter for us! Others with
smiling faces were eagerly devouring their home news.
I must say I came away feeling very sad and lonely.
It is just a month since we left home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the journey my husband fired his first shot on
Canadian soil. He killed a fine duck, and afterwards,
three prairie chickens. We are greatly looking forward
to a nice savoury dinner to-day—the first hot meal for
a long time. We cannot feel too thankful that we are
all safe so far. To others there have been many mishaps,
and no wonder—the bogs, ravines, and gullies
we passed were really fearful. Our good horses have
done splendidly. We are quite enjoying the rest to-day.
The vastness of this country is wonderful. Although
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
we have passed through so much already, our courage
is still undaunted.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On leaving Battleford we had a ninety-mile
journey through most awful country. It shook us all
to pieces, what with driving through thick scrub and
charging across great streams and ravines. Simply
perished with cold and hunger, we reached the Government
tents at our journey’s end. We all felt weary,
worn, and sad. My little Doris was taken ill the day
before we arrived, and my husband’s first care, on
reaching Mr. Barr’s camp, was to seek out the doctor.
She had a temperature of 104; but, thanks to poultices
and medical care, she soon pulled round. Then Barnes
was taken ill; and I suppose all this worry and anxiety
proved the last straw as far as I was concerned, for I
was the next to collapse, with a bad chill and bronchitis,
together with an abscess on my face, all of which combined
to make me feel very low and out of sorts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much for the first ordeal, to which this family
and their fellow-colonists need not have been subjected
in 1903. That long trek, accomplished by makeshift
means of their own providing, put them on a sort of
post-dated equality with settlers who arrived in pre-railway
days. Indeed, save that the country was now
free from Indian savages and belligerent fur-traders,
Mr. and Mrs. Rendall and their two little children
might have been living a hundred years ago, and
traversing the North-West in one of Lord Selkirk’s
parties of pioneers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the journey was, after all, of minor moment.
Dumped down in the wilderness, isolated from civilisation,
with no road or river service to connect them with
the populated world, those English families had now
somehow to strike root as a self-supporting community.
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
Two hundred miles from a railway! Truly it was a
formidable handicap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I will resume the personal story: “We arrived
at our destination,” the husband recorded, “on May
10th, and remained in camp until May 15th. Prairie
fires raged around on all sides, giving rise to serious
anxiety. At one time, for the safety of the whole camp,
it was necessary to summon out all the men, horses,
and ploughs that were available.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we reached Mr. Barr’s camp,” the lady
stated, “my husband went to survey the section of land
allotted to him; but he was not at all satisfied, and
would have nothing to do with it. So Mr. Barr went
with him to look at a different section, which resulted
most happily for my husband. He is perfectly satisfied
with his new location, and considers he is the proud
possessor of as fine a tract of land as is possible to be
procured. As I now sit writing, I can look out at my
tent door and see him quite happy doing his first bit of
ploughing on his own soil. There is no doubt it is
most beautiful land. We have plenty of wood and
water, which is a great boon and much to be thankful
for. Our friend and travelling companion, Mr. Young,
has the adjoining land, which is just as good as ours.
We are only half an hour’s drive from the stores in
Mr. Barr’s camp, half a mile from the prospective railway
station, and only a few minutes’ walk from the
school site.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Mr. Rendall’s account of the initial efforts
we learn one or two additional facts: “On May 15th,”
he wrote, “we pitched our tents at last on our own
domain, with a feeling of thankfulness that journeying
was over and the goal reached at last. I started the
very next day to plough, and in less than a week had
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
ploughed and tilled three acres of oats, and, by the
following week, an acre and a half of barley and half
an acre of potatoes. At the time of writing (July 22nd)
everything is looking splendid considering late sowing.
I am much pleased with my land, which is good soil
and easy to plough.” He criticised the conditions under
which the colonists were existing, and added: “I cannot
speak too highly in praise of the valuable and kindly
assistance of the Government officials, who have spared
no trouble in smoothing away our difficulties so far as
they are able.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going back to May, we read in the lady’s diary:
“I think the country all round here will be very pretty
in a short while. We are now hunting out a nice spot
for our little house, which we are anxious to get up as
soon as possible. There is a gentleman in Mr. Barr’s
camp who thinks of returning home. He has the plan
of a four-room bungalow, and the timber all complete
for building it. If he does go back, he will sell it outright
to my husband; but the timber will have to be
fetched from Fort Pitt, twenty-five miles away. Barnes
goes to Battleford on Wednesday to fetch the rest of
our luggage, ploughs and harrows, and the cooking-stove.
There are plenty of prairie chickens and wild
duck all over the estate, and my husband’s gun keeps
us supplied. Yesterday and to-day we have thoroughly
enjoyed a delicious dinner of prairie chicken, beans, and
potatoes. The beans are like little white peas, and are
very good. We are getting some vegetable seed from
Battleford to start our kitchen garden as soon as possible.
I shall be so thankful when the warmer weather
sets in. I can quite understand the attraction of camping
then, but under present circumstances it has very
few charms; and, what with the bitter cold and the hard
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
ground, we do not get much refreshing rest. Still,
despite all the hardships, it is certainly a glorious feeling
to be able to look around on our very own property
and feel that each day’s work is for future benefit. No
landlord, and no rent to pay! And no taxes! That
does indeed compensate for a great deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On June 4th Mrs. Rendall had very sad tidings to
record: “Our poor friend and neighbour, Mr. Young,
took a chill a fortnight ago. He seemed so unwell when
my husband went up to see him in his own tent that I
suggested he should be driven down to us, and put in
Barnes’s vacant tent, where we could look after him.
This was done, and we sent for the camp doctor, who
said it was a serious case. On Friday and Saturday
Mr. Young became worse and was very delirious.
There happened to be an experienced male nurse in
camp, and he came out to remain at night. On Saturday
I was alone with the poor fellow while my husband
was driving the doctor back to camp. He told me he
knew he was going to die, and he asked me to note
down his wishes and write and cable to his wife. He
wished my husband to take charge of everything he
had till such time as we should receive instructions
from his family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He passed away at 3.30 a.m. on Saturday, May
24th, after only four days’ illness. It was an awful
blow to us. We had been such good friends, and he
and my husband were so much together. He was
buried the same evening, at seven, on his own ground,
the doctor and Mr. Lloyd making all arrangements.
We cabled the poor wife in Manchester, and I wrote
her a long letter giving all details, and we are now
awaiting instructions from her. They were coming out
this month. There are two sons—eighteen and twenty—and
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
two daughters—sixteen and thirteen. We have
the satisfaction of knowing we did everything we could
to save him. It all seems like a dream.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>THRESHING BY MACHINERY IN THE PRAIRIE PROVINCES</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>On a later date the lady wrote: “We are having
glorious weather, and as one looks around on the lovely
green grass, and the bushes in bright foliage, it is
difficult to realise that the ground was so recently
covered with snow. My husband’s oats are already well
up and are looking splendid. About a week ago we
managed to buy a cow and a calf, and I feel quite
proud that we not only have plenty of milk for ourselves,
but are able to supply a neighbour with a quart
a day. Yesterday we all thoroughly enjoyed a lovely
cup of cream for tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next Monday Barnes goes off to Onion Lake, Fort
Pitt, to fetch the lumber for our bungalow. We have
chosen the site.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;. As to the colony, Mr. Barr is
pretty well out of it now, and in his place we have the
Rev. Mr. Lloyd, a splendid man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On August 6th the lady with deep thankfulness recorded
that their bungalow, christened “Doris Court,”
was near completion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night,” she wrote, “we contemplate sleeping,
for the first time for four months, within the shelter
of four walls. July is the wet month here, and it is
easy to imagine the delights of being aroused from
your sleep by the rain trickling on you as you lie
in your tent.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since I wrote the above we have removed into our
very own domicile, and right proud we feel to look
around, even though at present the boards are bare.
From one window I can see our lovely oats and barley
looking splendid. From another window I see the
master of Doris Court ploughing away for dear life
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
with his fine pair of horses. Each acre ploughed means
a better prospect for the coming year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doris Court measures 30 feet by 30, and contains
five rooms, besides an attic which runs the full length
of the house and can be used as a bedroom, as we have
had it nicely floored and boarded. There are also two
very large cellars in which we can store all necessary
provisions for the winter. Everyone who sees our
house is of the same opinion, viz., that it is quite the
best home in the colony. There will be a veranda four
or five feet wide round three sides of the house, and
that will be lovely in the summer. We are going to
have a fine garden, not being stinted for ground, and
we hope in the spring to get some fruit and other trees
from the experimental farm. There is a great charm
and fascination in planning it all out, knowing it is
our own property. That fact compensates us for all the
hardships we have passed through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have gone to more expense over our house
than we intended in the first instance; but so many
persons will want putting up for the winter that we feel
it will repay us to have extra room. Already we have
had a lot of applications, which we have under consideration.
Our bungalow will be warmed throughout by
means of pipes from the kitchen stove, and from a
heating stove which is placed in the octagonal hall.
We burn nothing but wood. The fires have to be kept
going night and day during the winter, and we have
to put up double windows, viz., outside frames, which
can be removed in the summer. The wild flowers are
very lovely, and the small single sunflower is just now
in abundance all over our land. There are also
gaillardias, besides a kind of lily of the valley and a
red tiger lily.”
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The colony had a terrible experience which the lady
thus vividly described: “October 21st. Yesterday was
a day never to be forgotten. For nearly a week we
have been watching several huge prairie fires raging in
the distance, for we have feared that a change of wind
might bring a heavy disaster upon us. The night
before last was an anxious one, with the terrible circle
of fire gradually closing around us. The general
opinion was that we were safe for the night, but I could
not sleep. Next morning our worst fears were realised,
and we knew that a few hours would decide our fate.
The only safeguard against prairie fires is a broad belt
of ploughing all round your homestead. This my husband
had done, with the exception of one side, which,
alas! was the very side towards which the fire was
sweeping with awful rapidity. Needless to say, the
plough was soon at work, and it was literally ploughing
for dear life. Every available tub was filled with
water. Sacks were collected to be in readiness for beating
out the flames when the time should come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Rendall, Barnes, and another man who is
working for us were all on the alert, watching with
intense eagerness all the different points. Meanwhile
within the house I, together with Mrs. H., who is
boarding with us for the winter, and Mrs. B., who
nursed me when my little girl was born, stood gazing
out of the window. Each of us had a baby in our arms,
and each also had two other children to look after. So
in all we mustered nine little ones, each under six years
of age. Our young flock fortunately were not able to
realise the deadly peril we were in, and we had to
keep on rounding them up in readiness for hasty flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I collected a few little valuables, and looked around
with a very heavy heart, wondering what would become
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
of us if in an hour or two we should be homeless. At
last we could stand still no longer; so we three women
rushed out, and, filling our aprons with the clay and
soil dug up from the foundations, we scattered it all
over the ground around the house. The wind was
blowing a hurricane, bringing, or rather driving, the
fire straight on to us. The awful roar of the flames was
enough to make the bravest shudder, and the smoke
and smell were suffocating. My husband continued
ploughing until absolutely compelled to stop owing to
the heat and smoke. Our two men meanwhile drenched
the roof with water; then, arming themselves with wet
sacks, they hurried to the weakest points to try and
prevent the flames jumping the fire-guard, which was
only 150 yards off the house all round. We could do
nothing more. We could only wait with bated breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last came the joyful cry ‘Safe!’ from the
western side. But the danger was not yet over, for on
the north-west we were again threatened, and it was
there the horses had been placed for safety. All hands
had to fly round to meet the enemy at the fresh point
of attack, and after a hard fight the dreaded foe, thanks
to cool heads and strong arms, was kept at bay. At
the end of a short time of awful suspense and anxiety,
my husband came back to us with the welcome assurance,
‘All danger over! Safe for another year!’ We
were too overjoyed for words, and after the dreadful
strain of so many hours you may pretty well guess what
the reaction was like. Mr. Rendall was literally fagged
out, but when we had had a little rest and refreshment
we all felt better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our loss was only four tons of hay, but many of
our neighbours lost all their hayricks. The fire started
by the Vermilion River, and was raging for days before
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
it reached us and swept on towards Battleford. There
is no doubt whatever that our fire-guard in a great
measure saved the town site.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Apart from the horror of it, that fire was a most
wonderful sight. Of course, on the prairie you can see
for an enormous distance, and for thirty or forty miles
there was nothing but flames. How thankful we were
the fire reached us in the morning and not at night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When next the diarist took up her pen, it was to
record interesting domestic details: “We muster fifteen
at present—quite a big family to cater and cook for.
My little ones are quite happy, the Canadian baby
being especially bonny, and thriving splendidly. The
town site is all surveyed, and the Government has
decided to grant a plot to every colonist who cares to
apply for it. Mr. Rendall, Barnes, and I have each
got one, and we intend erecting a little store of our
own for the disposal of our dairy produce. We are
hoping to get two or three more cows soon. Everyone
likes our butter, made in the old Devonshire fashion.
I have been for a drive to-day, and the town is growing
very, very fast, dozens of little shacks springing up all
round. There are two large general stores, two
restaurants, the post office, a butcher’s shop, and a
blacksmith’s, all within twenty minutes’ walk of Doris
Court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On December 10th Mrs. Rendall wrote: “Everything
is going ahead now with amazing rapidity. We
have been fortunate in having most glorious weather—continuous
sunshine from day to day and hard frost at
night. Our clergyman, Mr. Lloyd, is a very musical
man, and every Wednesday holds a choir practice at
his own house. The first hour is devoted to music for
the following Sunday service, after which we have
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
secular quartets, trios, duets, and solos—all the best
music he can muster. He has now formed a musical
union. I need scarcely say I have joined, and I
thoroughly enjoy the practices, they are so splendidly
conducted. We really have a very fine choir. Every
Thursday evening there is either a concert or a debate
on some popular and instructive topic. It has been
decided to erect a structure which for the time being
will serve as a church, a school, and a recreation-room.
Everyone is giving a log (it is, of course, to be built of
logs), and the name of each donor is to be engraved
thereon by his or her own hand. All the labour of
erecting the building is to be done voluntarily, different
persons having promised one or two days’, or in some
cases a week’s, work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Progress is indeed remarkable. With regard to
our choral union, the idea is for all the places round
about, such as Battleford and Onion Lake, to form
branches and practise the same music, so that from
time to time we can have a meeting of the massed
choir. Our choir has already been invited to Onion
Lake, which is thirty-six miles away. The whole party
is to go in sleighs, of which the colony now has a
supply. We use them with our wagon-boxes. It is a
delightful sensation to be gliding over the snow, which
is not soft as in England, but hard and crisp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everyone is in great excitement just now, because
we have to elect an overseer (the same as our English
mayor), and canvassing is going on pretty smartly. So,
with one thing and another, we are quite busy. The
little ones are all well, happy, and growing very rapidly.
My wee Canadian is the happiest baby I have ever
seen. Mr. Rendall has just bought a piece of land,
consisting of 320 acres, adjoining our homestead.
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
When the railway comes, that land will be very
valuable. We have bought a one-year-old calf for $11,
with a ton of hay thrown in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After giving an account of enjoyable social gatherings
and frolics at Christmas and New Year’s Eve, our
chronicler added: “We are most amused at the reports
that reach us from England as to the terrible plight we
are in, even to the verge of starvation! As a matter
of fact we are quite happy and contented, and very
much better off in every way than we were in England.
As for food, we certainly live as well as ever we did.
There are now two butchers in the town. Our meat is
delivered at the door, and is of the very best quality.
Certainly we have had difficulties to surmount and hardships
to endure, but we quite expected them when we
left England; and at that time we treasured up a reserve
fund of determination and pluck which stood us in
good stead when the need came. I would never advise
anyone to come out here who is the least afraid of work—they
are better off at home. There is plenty of room
to breathe in this country, and if the work is hard, the
freedom—which is the inevitable attribute of the life
here—makes one far less susceptible to physical fatigue
than one was in the old country, where there is a feeling
of weighty oppression to handicap one’s energies. Here
one feels that each week’s work is a step onwards, while
ten years’ hard toil in Devonshire brought nothing but
disappointment and additional anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no doubt whatever that Lloydminster bids
fair to become a very important centre. Its growth
week by week is marvellous. The Government are now
erecting a large immigration hall in anticipation of the
arrival of new-comers in the spring. Meetings are
being held now to discuss and perfect arrangements for
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
receiving expected friends and families and ensure their
safe conduct right up to the colony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far we have passed through the winter splendidly,
and up to the time of writing (January 19th) we
have brilliant sunshine from one week’s end to another.
Our bungalow is kept beautifully warm. We have a
good supply of wood from our own land, and so the
price of coal is an item over which we have no need
to worry. We have to pay very dearly for flour—$4½
for 100 lb. It is of course freightage that makes things
dear. It is expected that the railway will be here and
working in a year from now, and then everything will
be cheaper. The telegraph will be in working order in
a few weeks’ time. We have two large general stores,
a drug store, and a resident doctor, with a hospital in
view. Our choral union now numbers 120 members,
and a rifle corps is being formed with 160 names enrolled.
At the time of writing there are twenty-eight
degrees of frost, and those who have been outside say
it is a bit nippy. If we do not take proper precautions
to protect our noses and ears, we are liable to get them
frost-bitten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The land here is of splendid quality and fit to grow
anything, being specially adapted for mixed farming.
And when I remember all these things, I cannot help
smiling to think of those in the old country who have
been commiserating our lot. They have far greater
need for pity than we, for while they are still plodding
and hibernating, we are on the progressive, and are
probably making greater headway in twelve months
than they in as many years. For Canada is nothing if
not a go-ahead country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this point, probably because of superior
claims upon her attention, Mrs. Rendall allowed a long
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
break to occur in her instructive record of a settler’s
experiences. When, several months later, she resumed
the narrative, it was to say: “Much has happened since
I last wrote, and I hardly know where to begin. Lloydminster
is quite a little town. The railway is here, and
the station is a pretty addition to our buildings. Little
did I think that the whistle of an engine would ever
sound so sweet! The passenger service is not properly
organised yet, and the line is still in the hands of the
construction party. But as soon as the line is
entirely completed, and it is handed over to the
Canadian Northern Railway Company, we shall have
a regular service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the past two years we have lived in comparative
isolation, sometimes being left for three weeks
together without the slightest notion of what was going
on in the outside world. We were completely at the
mercy of the weather for news and provisions, all
having to come by road from Saskatoon; and when
they did come, the price of the commonest necessaries
was enough to make the pluckiest feel occasionally
downhearted. ‘It will be different when we have the
railway,’ became a stock phrase. But it was weary
waiting, and many of us had almost lost hope, when
one day we heard that the rails had been laid within
two miles of Lloydminster. Less than a week later, the
first train arrived. Since then there has been quite a
revolution in the price of everything. Flour, for which
we had paid $4½ to $5 per 100 lb., is now $2.80, top
price; and the cost of all other provisions is decreasing
in proportion. Lumber, too, is coming down in
price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Town lots have been on the market and bought at
high values. Everyone is now to build lumber houses
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
instead of log shacks. Bricks, too, are being extensively
used for buildings. What a transformation!
When we arrived in May, 1903, about a dozen tents
were all there was to see on the bare prairie. Now
three large hotels are in course of erection, there are
stores of all kinds, and even a branch of the Canadian
Bank of Commerce is going up. There is also a printing
office, from which is issued weekly our newsy little
paper, <span class='it'>The Lloydminster Times</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This year we have had fifty acres under cultivation.
Our grain is not threshed so far, as the threshing
outfit has not been our way yet. The general yield of
oats is about 50 bushels to 60 bushels per acre—of
wheat, 25 bushels. We have two acres of potatoes—a
splendid crop, though early frost spoilt half before they
could be got out of the ground. From 4 lb. of seed
from the experimental farm, Mr. Rendall had a yield of
136 lb., many of the potatoes weighing over 20 oz.
Our garden produce was splendid. We picked several
hundredweight of peas, and disposed of them in the
town, one restaurant taking nearly all we could supply.
We have put on a large addition to our house in the
shape of a substantial log building, 14 feet by 18 feet,
which will serve as a granary in winter and an extra
kitchen in the summer. Mr. Rendall is now completing
a fine log stable, 30 feet by 15 feet. We have some
very good cows, and our milk is now disposed of right
away and fetched from the door, so that we have no
bother.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Last autumn I visited Mr. and Mrs. Rendall and
their fifteen hundred neighbours—a healthy, happy, and
prosperous community. The town of Lloydminster,
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
with its large and handsome banks, hotels, churches,
schools, and hospital, was a visible part of the abundant
wealth which the Barr colonists, by growing grain on
27,000 acres of hitherto useless prairie, had brought
into being—and all in less than eight years!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span><h1 id='t6323'>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>WINNIPEG AND THE CENTENARY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>For over a century, as I have already pointed out,
Western Canada formed part of a vast theatre in which
the fur traders enacted their stirring, if somewhat
squalid, drama. Of the several men who figured prominently
in the history of that period, there was one
whose memory should be revered by Canadians of To-day
and To-morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philanthropy knows no higher work than to rescue
capable and industrious men from a country where they
cannot support their families, and emigrate them to a
country where they can. In that work—which is so
largely a modern development rendered possible by
modern conditions—Lord Selkirk was a remarkable
pioneer. He was a seer, born far ahead of his times.
One hundred years ago he saw the possibility of settling
Western Canada. In an age that knew nothing
of steamships and railroads, he had a prevision of farming
on the prairie. Had his aspirations remained an
unrealised dream, we should have sufficient occasion to
honour the memory of a prophet. But that kind-hearted
and resolute Scotsman realised his dream. Encountering
difficulty after difficulty, he overcame them. He
found his time of day sadly out of tune with a scheme
for putting the landless man on the manless land, but
he achieved that desirable end. It is, indeed, to the
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
everlasting credit of Lord Selkirk that he successfully
tackled a twentieth-century job at the dawn of the nineteenth
century. While the warlike traders were losing
their tempers and their lives over the business of collecting
pelts, the unselfish nobleman was putting in
some quiet, steady work on behalf of humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the terrible Napoleonic wars, great destitution
occurred among the humbler classes in Great Britain,
and specially in the Highlands of Scotland. Lord Selkirk’s
aim was to benefit his needy fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In June, 1811, three ships left the Thames to call
at Stornoway, in the Hebrides, for the first party of
settlers bound for Central Canada. The emigrants, as
they went on board, were presented with a lying
pamphlet describing their destination as a Polar region
infested with hostile Indians. They were encouraged
to return ashore for a good-bye spree on their native
soil. A “customs officer” stepped aboard and played
exasperating tricks with their baggage. Another bogus
official came rowing alongside to ascertain whether
every emigrant was leaving Scotland of his own free
will. (Lord Selkirk’s protégés dealt with this point
by dropping a nine-pound cannon-ball into the gentleman’s
boat.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus early and artfully did the fur-traders of the
North-West Company seek to thwart colonising. But
the emigrants sailed, and two months later they arrived
on the shores of Hudson Bay, where they remained
in huts during a long, wearisome winter and spring.
In the first week of July they started in boats down
Hayes River to Lake Winnipeg, and so to the Forks,
on the Red River, where they arrived by the end of
August. Wondering Indians came to gaze at the
white strangers who had arrived on the prairie, not to
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
collect furs and not to hunt, but—by all that was
mysterious and incredible—to make things grow in the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile another party of Lord Selkirk’s colonists
had left Scotland. Again there were unseen enemies
at work. Mutiny was fomented on the voyage, but,
after one man had had an arm cut off, the affair fizzled
out. Of that second party to arrive at Hudson Bay,
some eight or ten men pushed on in the same year to
Red River. Three of them tarried by the way to do
some fishing, and when they set out to accomplish the
last stage of their journey, winter set in, they ran short
of provisions, and their strength gave out. Two lay
down on the windswept ice to die. “The third,” Agnes
Laut tells us, “hurried desperately forward, hoping
against hope, doggedly resolved, if he must perish, to
die hard. Suddenly a tinkling of dog-bells broke the
winter stillness, and the pack-trains of North-West
hunters came galloping over the ice. In a twinkling the
overjoyed colonist had signalled them and told his
story, and in less time than it takes to relate, the Nor’-Westers
were off to the rescue. The three starving
men were cared for till they regained strength. Then
they were given food enough to supply them for the
rest of the way to the settlement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yearly contingents went out, and it is recorded that
the emigrants of 1813 included young girls going to
make a home for aged parents, a patriarch and his
wife who had been evicted from their Scottish home,
Irish Catholics, staid Scotch Presbyterians, dandified
Glasgow clerks, red-cheeked Orkneymen, younger
sons of noble families, and shy and demure Moravian
sisters and brethren. They had their trials. There was
an outbreak of typhus on the voyage; on their
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
subsequent trek across country, they cut their feet on
ridge stones, and sometimes had to wade waist-deep
through swamps; and once they ran short of food and
were reduced to eating nettle leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To pave the way for his colony, Lord Selkirk had
bought a controlling interest in the Hudson’s Bay Company.
But that company and the Nor’-Westers were
still at deadly feud. The peaceful settlers found themselves
in a hornets’ nest. They were terrified by the
portents of a gathering storm. Half-breeds went about
singing their war songs; musketry firing was heard at
night. A section of the colonists suffered the Nor’-Westers
to escort them to the security of Eastern
Canada. The others remained to see the forts of the
rival traders dealing out death and destruction. At
one time the colony buildings were set on fire, the
Selkirk settlers fled in terror to Lake Winnipeg, and
nothing remained but their charred homes and trampled
crops. Then came two hundred fighting men under
the Hudson’s Bay flag, and as they brought word that
Governor Semple was on his way to take command,
bringing with him 160 additional colonists, and that
Lord Selkirk himself would arrive in the following year,
the agriculturists returned to Red River and started all
over again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Governor Semple had not been long at Red River
before he and his staff, with a few other persons, were
killed, whereupon the Hudson’s Bay stronghold (Fort
Douglas) fell into the enemy’s hands. Poor colonists!
they were tilling the soil in a very noisy neighbourhood.
New excitement was provided in the following year,
when Lord Selkirk (now a very warlike philanthropist)
arrived with several hundred discharged soldiers and retook
Fort Douglas. After that, the colonists experienced
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
less troubled times; and when the two fur-trading companies
coalesced in 1821 an era of peace dawned for the
district. Meanwhile, harassed, weary and ill, the
founder of the colony had gone to France, where on
November 8th, 1820, a noble life drew to a pathetic
close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fate lavished her favours on Thomas Douglas, fifth
Earl of Selkirk and Baron Daer. He possessed youth,
health, wealth, position and power. And he applied
those blessings, not to selfish ends, but to the service
of humanity. I like the simple words in which Lord
Selkirk’s character was described by his contemporary
and friend, Sir Walter Scott. The great novelist testified
to his “generous and disinterested disposition,” and
to his “talents and perseverance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Selkirk is to have a memorial, and a memorial
worthy of the man and his work. The Centenary of the
foundation of the Selkirk settlement (from which Manitoba
has sprung) is likely to be celebrated in 1914 by
an exhibition at Winnipeg—an exhibition of a character
and on a scale to arouse interest in, and attract visitors
from, all quarters of the globe. Indeed, the Dominion
has thoughts of celebrating the occasion by holding
its first “World’s Fair,” after the pattern set by London
forty-nine years ago, by Philadelphia twelve years later,
by Paris in the opening year of this century, and by
Chicago in 1893.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are several reasons why a Winnipeg Exhibition
justifies high hopes. On previous occasions,
millions of people, travelling across oceans and continents,
have visited a World’s Fair in order to see—a
World’s Fair. People would be attracted to the
Manitoba capital in 1914 to see that and something
more. It would be an opportunity to witness a rare
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
spectacle—the rising of a new nation that is destined to
be big and powerful. For thousands of people it would
be a chance to take a peep at the prairie—to see with
their own eyes the Great North-West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These International Expositions are occasions when
one part of the world says to the rest of the world:
“Come and see what <span class='it'>we</span> are doing.” Visitors go with
the intention of combining business with pleasure; and
certainly no World’s Fair would ever have been held in
a country that presents such opportunities for investment
and enterprise. The Winnipeg Show would take its
international public to the very border of probably the
greatest area of rich, unoccupied land to be found in the
world. It would reveal a territory that is producing sufficient
wheat to supply the whole population of England
with bread, and producing it from soil which, for the
most part, was only recently brought under cultivation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, the Winnipeg Exhibition would serve to
celebrate an event of which I have endeavoured to
measure the significance. The one hundredth anniversary
of the Selkirk settlement will witness the opening
of through communication, <span class='it'>via</span> Hudson Bay, between
Western Canada and Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Press of the Dominion took at once to the
daring and delightful idea of a World’s Fair at Winnipeg;
and the more enthusiastic editors exclaimed: “We
must see to it that this is a record-breaking exhibition.”
That is certainly the right spirit in which to tackle a
great undertaking. The Paris Exhibition of 1900 holds,
I believe, the record, with an attendance of 50,860,801
visitors. But of course Paris is situated in a more
populous hemisphere than the one in which Winnipeg
occurs; so it would be fairer to regard the Chicago
Exhibition of 1893 (which attracted 27,539,521 visitors)
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
as the achievement to be eclipsed. Though, indeed,
having regard to relative population, Canada’s triumph
would be sufficiently remarkable if her first World’s Fair
compared favourably with the first World’s Fair of the
United States. It was held at Philadelphia in 1876,
and the attendance was 9,910,996, or over 3,000,000
more than the attendance at either of London’s great
exhibitions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Last year, when at Winnipeg, I called at the executive
offices of “Canada’s International Exposition and
Selkirk Centennial, 1914,” and there I learnt that preparations
for the event were well advanced. The project
was associated with £1,000,000. Half was expected
from the Federal Government, most of the balance being
provided by the following grants: £100,000 from the
City of Winnipeg; £100,000 from the Canadian Pacific
Railway; £100,000 from the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway;
£50,000 from the Canadian Northern Railway;
and £50,000 from the province of Manitoba. To complete
the £1,000,000, the business men in Winnipeg
were asked to take up stock to the extent of £100,000;
which they promised to do. The directors undertook
to lay out that million pounds to advantage; and it was
estimated that buildings and exhibits provided by the
various Canadian, British and Foreign Governments
would represent a value equal to another million. So
that persons who visit Winnipeg in the summer of 1914
are likely to have a good time and find plenty to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, if they saw nothing but Winnipeg
itself their time and money would be well spent.
It is a marvellous and a magnificent city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One department of the Federal Government of Canada
presents the stirring spectacle of many scientists working
at high pressure and in high spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Savants in Great Britain are wont to act with a
deliberation that might almost be called leisurely, the
daily life of our learned societies being characterised
by placidity rather than precipitancy. They have been
investigating the minerals and the fauna and flora of
their little country now for some centuries, and though
there may be an insect or two still to be caught and
classified, the matter is not pressing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An extremely opposite state of things obtains in
Canada. It was only the other day, so to speak, that
it set up in business as a unity and a nation, and at
that time next to nothing was known accurately about
its natural features. Soil, rocks, climate, fish, trees,
birds—none had been properly overhauled. The
farmers, the miners, and the railway constructors called
urgently for information that could not be supplied.
In a word, there was a bewildering lack of all the
precise knowledge on which every large community
unconsciously rests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the Federal Government, as one of their
earliest concerns, set to work on a sort of scientific
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
stock-taking—a process that is still in full blast. They
got together all the good scientists they could lay their
hands on—geologists, mineralogists, geographers,
botanists, naturalists, chemists, meteorologists, ethnologists
and the like—and hustled them off to find
out all they could about Canada; and, since that sort of
person is born rather than made, the Federal Government
early found themselves confronting a shortage of
human material—a kind of famine of scientists—which
was the more regrettable since there was so much
ground to be covered, such appalling arrears to overtake.
However, recruits were imported, and educational
facilities were provided for the rising generation of
professors, and to-day there are in the Government
service of Canada as fine and mobile an army of
scientific men as, I imagine, could anywhere be found
on this planet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It makes one almost giddy to think of all those
Government geologists hurrying every year across the
country—one to study the economic minerals of New
Brunswick, another to visit the goldfields of British
Columbia, a third to tabulate the copper-bearing rocks of
Sherbrooke, a fourth to visit the mica mines of Hudson
Strait, a fifth to scrutinise the surface geology of the
Great Plains, a sixth to collect facts about tin-bearing
strata in Nova Scotia, a seventh to explore the raised
shore-lines of the Blue Mountain escarpment. Some
have been packed off at a moment’s notice—for example,
to inspect a collapsing mountain (the people living at
the base having become anxious), and to report upon
a meteorite that had just fallen in somebody’s homestead
(and which, when the scientist arrived, had already
been sold for two hundred dollars). It does one’s heart
good to think of the stream of scientists, booty laden
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
and full of enthusiasm, returning at the end of the
season: the triumphant mineralogist, with his diamond-bearing
chromite, his apatite crystals, and his pink scapolite;
the zealous zoologist, with eggs of the chickadee
and the belted kingfisher, some rare fresh-water mussels,
an albino skunk, and scores of marine fishes in alcohol;
the brother naturalist, with treasure unthinkable of seaslugs,
toads, and seaworms; the ethnologist, with his
human skulls and bones, and his stone adzes and
hammers; the perspiring palæontologist, with goodly
parcels of fossil bryozoa, supplemented, it may be, by
the tail of a scarce trilobite and the right posterior
molar tooth of a ruminant belonging to the order
Ovibos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give some idea of the industry and activity of
these learned servants of the State, I will briefly outline
the work accomplished by one naturalist in one season.
Having put his “Catalogue of Canadian Birds” through
the press, Mr. John Macoun made ready to depart for
Vancouver Island, his preparations including the compilation
of a list of all the plants that had been reported
to occur there. Before starting he also superintended
one assistant in arranging botanical sheets for the
herbarium, and another assistant in re-labelling a
quantity of mammal and bird skins. Then, having
sought and obtained permission “to write up the entire
natural history of Vancouver Island,” he departed to
Victoria with an assistant, the two energetic enthusiasts
at once setting to work to secure flowering plants and
the eggs of migrating birds and “to collect the fauna
and flora of the sea”—in which work they were “very
successful.” By June they were at Departure Bay,
“ranging the country for miles around” to tabulate
the birds and secure samples of plants and trees. “I
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
was also employed,” Mr. Macoun reported, “in collecting
from the sea, especially sea-weeds.” Going posthaste
to Nanaimo, he met by appointment another
assistant, whereupon, securing a boat, they carried out
some exhaustive dredging operations. One haul, at
twenty-five fathoms, brought up sixty specimens of a
rare hexactinellid sponge. They took 156 star-fish, 195
crabs of various kinds, over a hundred different sponges,
“a fine collection of barnacles,” and “a very large
collection of marine shells.” Both assistants “were indefatigable.”
One went out every evening with a lamp
and net and caught moths and beetles. “This collection
alone numbered over 600 specimens.” The party
captured 1,100 species of flowering plants, about 400
species of cryptogams, and nearly 150 species of sea
weeds; and the naturalist decided that another season’s
work would enable him “to write an exhaustive report
of the whole fauna and flora of the island,” provided he
again had those two most excellent assistants with him.
Remembering he had promised to visit Rossland and
inquire into the rotting of mine timbers there, he darted
off on that mission, found that four species of fungus
were responsible, explained that the evil would be prevented
if the timber were treated with a strong saline
solution, and then went hurrying back to Ottawa, where
he set about naming a number of plants that had been
received from Guelph, Winnipeg, Calgary, and other
places. He also seriously tackled the question of the
flora of the Ottawa district—after which, I dare say,
Mr. Macoun began to feel tired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When in Ottawa, I found myself fascinated by this
scientific overhauling of the great Dominion, and an
interest which at first was of an abstract and general
character, presently took concrete and definite form.
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
I decided to seek for an authoritative and comprehensive
pronouncement concerning the mineral resources of the
country, and for this purpose I sought an interview with
Mr. R. W. Brock, the director of the Geological Survey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” he said, when, in opening up the
subject, I suggested that investigations could not at
present have advanced very far; “we are a long way
from having measured the mineral wealth of this vast
country. Much of the territory has not been explored
in even the most cursory way, while anything like a
detailed examination of the rocks has at present been
possible in only very limited areas. Still, the information
we have already accumulated is sufficient to reveal
Canada’s main geological features, to supply a rough
indication of the districts that will yield minerals, and
to show that the Dominion is destined to become one
of the greatest mining countries in the world. For the
amount of mineral land awaiting the prospector is
prodigious—the greatest, in fact, that now anywhere
remains unexploited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told Mr. Brock that, before going into the question
of the wealth awaiting discovery, I should like to have
from him a general statement of the valuable mineral
deposits that had already come to light. Accordingly
he was so good as to furnish me with the following
particulars:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coal is abundant and is extensively worked in the
eastern and western provinces. The more important
mines are situated in Nova Scotia, British Columbia,
and Alberta. New Brunswick produces small quantities
of coal for local use, and lignites are mined to some
extent in Saskatchewan. Iron is found in most parts
of Canada, but only in Nova Scotia, Ontario, and
Quebec is it as yet of industrial importance, and there
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
it is developed on only a limited scale. Substantial
progress is, however, being made, and notable expansion
may be expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gold is worked in British Columbia, Yukon
Territory, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Quebec, and
along certain rivers of Alberta. In British Columbia
the lode mines now furnish the principal production,
but placers are still of importance. Ontario and Nova
Scotia have only lode mining. Elsewhere placer mining
furnishes the gold. Silver is derived from the rich ores
of Northern Ontario and the silver-lead mines of British
Columbia. The extraordinary development of the silver
district of Cobalt and Montreal River has placed that
region in the premier position among the silver camps
of the world. An important addition to the output of
silver is contributed by the gold-copper ores of British
Columbia. A certain amount is also produced in the
copper-sulphur ores of Quebec.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Copper is furnished by British Columbia, Ontario,
and Quebec, and its production in the first-named
province is rapidly expanding. Lead is almost entirely
derived from the mines of British Columbia, but it also
occurs in the other provinces. Zinc is widely distributed,
but the production is as yet light and mostly
from the lead mines of British Columbia. Nickel is
largely confined to the mines of the Sudbury district
in Ontario—mines that are, however, by far the most
important in the world. A certain amount is produced
in the Cobalt district, while prospects still farther north,
resembling the Sudbury occurrences, are undergoing
development. Manganese, in the form of its oxides, is
produced intermittently in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
Mercury has been furnished in small quantity
by British Columbia.
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Platinum occurs in some gold placer deposits in
British Columbia, and also in the nickel-copper ores of
Sudbury. Tin and wolfram have recently been found
in the gold veins of Nova Scotia. Wolfram also occurs
in British Columbia and New Brunswick. Tin-bearing
minerals have been discovered in some pegmatites of
Eastern Ontario and Quebec. Arsenic is obtained in
connection with gold ores in Eastern Ontario and in the
silver ores of Cobalt. Antimony is produced to some
extent in Nova Scotia. It is being developed in New
Brunswick and at a few points in British Columbia.
Chromite is mined in Quebec.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Asbestos is the chief mining product of Quebec,
and the deposits of this mineral in that province are
the most important in the world. Graphite occurs in
important deposits in Eastern Ontario and Quebec, but
the industry is not fully developed. Gypsum is extensively
mined in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. It
is also mined in Ontario. It occurs in other provinces
as well, and is beginning to attract attention in British
Columbia. Mica is an important product of Ontario
and Quebec, where it occurs in shoots in veins. Some
of the deposits are very large. Phosphate of lime, or
apatite, is still produced, generally as a by-product of
the mica mines. Corundum is found extensively in
Eastern Ontario from deposits which, as regards purity
and magnitude, are unique. Feldspar occurs in wonderful
purity in Eastern Ontario and Quebec, and is of
considerable industrial importance. Pyrites is now
mined extensively in Ontario and to some extent in
Quebec.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Petroleum and natural gas are obtained in Ontario.
Alberta is also yielding a large quantity of gas, and
will probably develop petroleum fields. Gas and some
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
oil are now being produced in New Brunswick. Salt
of a very excellent quality is obtained in Ontario.
New Brunswick and Manitoba also furnish a certain
amount. Magnesite occurs in Quebec, and hydro-magnesite
in British Columbia. Structural materials
and clay products are found throughout the country,
and their production is rapidly growing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, Mr. Brock,” I said, “will you please tell
me on what data you base your confident prophecy
that Canada will become one of the richest mining
countries in the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” replied the head of the Geological Survey,
“you must know that North America consists of a
series of natural zones running roughly north and
south, and therefore the vast mineral wealth that has
been already discovered in the developed and populated
southern, or United States, part of those zones, supplies
a sure clue to the vast mineral wealth awaiting discovery
in the northern, or Canadian, part, which is only now
beginning to be developed and populated. That is no
mere theoretical deduction. It is supported by accumulating
facts. Thus geological explorers report the
occurrence of the same minerals and the same disposition
of strata in the north as one finds in the south.
Moreover, if you examine the results obtained to-day
by our most outlying camps, you will find that they
repeat the results obtained by the southern camps at
a corresponding stage of their development. Again,
geological discoveries follow the opening up of each
new section, and those discoveries all point to the same
conclusion, namely, that Nature has made the Republic
and the Dominion joint participators in a vast mineral
heritage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you please enumerate and define these
geological provinces that are so indifferent to international
boundaries?”</p>

<p class='caption'>ZONES OF MINERAL WEALTH</p>
</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>The map reproduced above, has been specially drawn for “Canada
To-day and To-morrow,” by Mr. R. W. Brock (Director of the Geological
Survey of the Dominion Government). It shows the great continuous
geological zones which have yielded vast mineral wealth in settled
southern areas, and of which—as high scientific authority confidently
predicts—equally rich fields await exploitation in the as yet unsettled
northern areas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The numbering of the five geological zones follows the order in which
they are mentioned in the accompanying chapter, namely, I, Appalachian
province: II, Lowland province: III, Laurentian plateau: IV, Interior
plain: V, Cordilleran belt.</p>

</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='180b' id='Page_180b'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are five main zones or provinces,” replied
Mr. Brock. “First there is what may be called the
Appalachian province, of which the Canadian portion
embraces south-east Quebec and the maritime provinces.
The Appalachian region is characterised by rock formations
which range from pre-Cambrian to carboniferous,
and which are typically disturbed and thrown into a
succession of folds. You will be aware that some of
the eastern United States are in the foremost rank of
the world’s mineral and industrial districts. They
occur in the Appalachian region, the best developed
State being Pennsylvania, which produces domestic
minerals to a yearly value of nearly £2,000 per square
mile. The same minerals occur over the Appalachian
extension into Canada. Important deposits of coal,
iron, and gold are mined in Nova Scotia. Of lesser
importance, but of considerable value, are the gypsum,
stone, and building-material industries in that province,
where manganese, antimony, tripolite, and barite are
also mined, while some attention is paid to copper;
indeed, Nova Scotia already has an annual mineral
production of about £200 per square mile. The comparison
between £200 and £2,000 may not seem
impressive, but it bears a fair relation to the difference
between the density of population in Pennsylvania and
in Nova Scotia. That matter of population is, of course,
vital, since mineral production, like agricultural production,
passes with the development of a country from
methods that are rough-and-ready to those that are
‘intensive.’ Expert authorities have estimated the coal
reserves of Nova Scotia at 6,000,000,000 tons. The
thickness of the carboniferous system is believed to be
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
in some parts 16,000 feet, and at the Joggins, on the
north arm of the Bay of Fundy, is a remarkable continuous
section showing 14,570 feet of strata, including
seventy seams of coal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the matter of mineral development New Brunswick
is still very backward. This is partly due to the
covering of soil, but mainly to the forested state of
large areas—conditions that make discoveries difficult.
Indeed, very little of the country has been prospected.
The principal products so far are gypsum, lime, coal,
building material, grindstones, clay, and mineral waters.
Iron promises to become important. Antimony is
being mined, while copper, lead, silver, nickel, gold,
etc., have been found. Shales rich in oils and ammonium
salts occur in large quantity. We have just
found very fine clay deposits in the maritime provinces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“South-east Quebec is already a high producer of
economic minerals. In addition to possessing the main
asbestos mines of the world, it has important industries
in chrome-iron ore, copper, and pyrites. Iron ores and
gold also occur there. And so I think I have supplied
you with plenty of reasons for agreeing that the
Appalachian area may ultimately give as good an
account of itself in Canada as it has in the United
States.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what of the next geological bond between the
Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next in order,” replied Mr. Brock, “comes the
Lowland province, embracing the southern portion of
Ontario and the valley of the St. Lawrence. It consists
mainly of flat-lying palæozoic rocks, and is, so to speak,
an extension of part of the State of New York. On
both sides of the international boundary the mineral
products are the same—namely, clay, cement, and other
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
building materials, as well as petroleum, natural gas,
salt, gypsum, and other non-metallic products. They
are extremely valuable, if they do not appeal to the
imagination in quite the same manner as the metallic
minerals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The two geological areas you have dealt with so
far,” I ventured to point out, “have covered only a
portion of Eastern Canada.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” replied Mr. Brock. “But the next
geological province to be considered embraces about
two million square miles, or more than one-half
of the Dominion. It may conveniently be called the
Laurentian plateau. It runs from Newfoundland to the
eastern border of Manitoba, embracing the vast territories
lying north of the St. Lawrence Valley, and
enclosing Hudson Bay like a huge V. It is an area
of pre-Cambrian rocks, and one extension passes into
New York State (where it supports some large and
varied mineral industries), and another extension crosses
into Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota (where it
provides the Michigan copper mines and the great Lake
Superior iron ranges).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These pre-Cambrian rocks are remarkable for the
variety of minerals they contain. Iron, copper, nickel,
cobalt, silver, gold, platinum, lead, zinc, arsenic, pyrite,
mica, apatite, graphite, feldspar, quartz, corundum,
talc, actinolite, the rare earths, ornamental stones and
gems, and building materials are found in the Laurentian
plateau, and nearly all of them are being profitably
mined. And since the list I have just given you is far
from complete, it would perhaps be better to describe
the wealth of the Laurentian plateau negatively.
Diamonds have not yet been located in that geological
region, though, I should add, as they have been found
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
in glacial drift brought from that area, they undoubtedly
occur there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far as Canada is concerned, the plateau is still,
in the main, an unvisited treasury. Over the greater
part of the area there have been nothing but the most
general scientific surveys. Our southern fringe of the
plateau is the only Canadian part that is known, and
even of that southern fringe merely a portion has been
prospected. Of the more important discoveries in that
southern fringe, you will not need to be reminded.
There are the gold ranges of the Lake of the Woods;
the silver of Thunder Bay; the iron ranges extending
from Minnesota for hundreds of miles to Quebec; the
copper rocks of Michipicoten and the Bruce mines;
the Sudbury copper-nickel deposit; the Montreal River
and Cobalt silver areas; the corundum deposits of
Eastern Ontario, and the magnetites of Eastern Ontario
and Quebec. It is true that few good merchantable
iron deposits have been found in our extensive iron
range formation; but in the Mesabi range—the richest
in the world—only about two per cent. is iron ore, so
that immediate discovery in the little prospected areas
in Canada is scarcely to be expected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And am I not right in supposing, Mr. Brock, that
the most sensational mineral discoveries have been
purely accidental?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so,” admitted the geologist. “The navvy,
in making his excavations, has blundered upon immense
treasure. Thus the greatest asbestos deposits of the
world were brought to light because a track for the
Quebec Central Railway happened to be blasted through
them. Then take the case of Cobalt, now the premier
silver camp. Although only a few miles from one of
the earliest routes of travel in the country, and although
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
only a few miles from a silver-lead deposit that has been
known for a hundred and fifty years, Cobalt was discovered
less than eight years ago, and then only because
a railway chanced to be cut through a rich vein. It
was a railway excavation, too, that revealed the Sudbury
nickel deposits. Still, you must not run away with the
idea that all the laurels have been won by the navvy.
To mention only one of the ‘finds’ made by our staff,
it was an officer of the survey who discovered the rich
corundum deposit extending in a belt one hundred miles
long. Yet that discovery serves, equally with those
of the navvy, to illustrate the unprospected nature of
Canada—even of those parts of Canada that have
been populated for a considerable period. For that
corundum was found in a district that had long been
settled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a field for explorers is that Laurentian
plateau! It is not possible for the most pessimistic
person to fear that Nature has, by a strange coincidence,
concentrated all the mineral wealth in the only part
that is populated—that southern fringe which, though
still only imperfectly prospected, has yielded over four
hundred million tons of iron ore, nearly five thousand
million pounds of copper, and immense quantities of
silver and the other minerals I have mentioned. The
explorations of the geological survey have shown that,
scattered over the whole area, are patches of all the
various formations that go to make up the pre-Cambrian;
while practically every mineral that occurs in
the south has been noted by explorers in the north. It
is therefore quite safe to assume that, in the great
northern areas as yet unattacked by the pick of the
prospector, are vast stores of minerals that will come
to light when the country is opened up.”
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I told Mr. Brock that, although he had dealt with
only three of the geological provinces shared by Canada
with the States, he had said enough to convince me that
the Dominion possessed adequate mineral wealth to
support its high destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still,” said Mr. Brock, “there is more to be told;
and this very imperfect survey of our mineral resources
must not be broken off in the middle. I now come
to the fourth geological province, which it is convenient
to name the Interior Plain. It embraces Alberta and
the bulk of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, extending
across the border into the Dakotas. It is pre-eminently
an agricultural country, and is notably deficient in
metallic minerals, as might be expected, because it is
underlain with a thick blanket of almost undisturbed
cretaceous and tertiary sediment. Gold dredging is
carried on in the sands and gravels of the North
Saskatchewan River below Edmonton; gypsum is mined
in Manitoba; salt occurs in that province and in the
lower Athabasca region; but with those exceptions,
and materials used in the building trades, the mineral
production of the Interior Plain is almost entirely confined
to fuels, which, however, are very important.
Natural gas over a wide area and under great pressure
has been tapped, and there is every indication of a large
oil field in, at any rate, the northern portion of Alberta,
while some oil has been encountered in the south-west.
The lower cretaceous sandstones along the Athabasca
River, where they come to the surface, are for miles
saturated with bitumen. These tar sands will probably
average twelve per cent. in maltha, or asphaltum.
Mr. R. G. McConnell saw tar sands occupying about
one thousand square miles, which, taking the thickness
at his estimate of 150 feet, would represent nearly five
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
thousand million tons of bitumen. The lignites of the
eastern plains are useful for local purposes, and beds
more highly bitumenised are met with as the mountains
are approached. Mr. D. B. Dowling has satisfied
himself that there are 7,500 square miles of coal land
in Saskatchewan, and nearly twenty thousand square
miles in Alberta, and he credits explored parts of the
last-named province with four hundred million tons of
anthracite, forty-four thousand million tons of bituminous
coal, and sixty thousand million tons of lignite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the story of Canada’s wealth is still unfinished?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most impressive part,” replied Mr. Brock,
“has still to come. We have now to consider the fifth
geological province—the Cordilleran Belt. In Canada
it has a length of 1,300 and a width of 400 miles, and
it extends across the western States, through Mexico,
and into South America. Its rocks range from the
oldest to the youngest formations. Vulcanism and
mountain-building processes have repeatedly been
active in that province. The Cordilleran Belt is recognised
as one of the greatest mining regions in the
world, it being noted principally for its gold, silver,
copper and lead. Of the well-nigh incalculable wealth
of gold and other minerals in California and Mexico I
need not remind you. And the riches of the Cordilleran
Belt in the south afford a sure clue to its
riches in the north. In Canada and Alaska the geological
province is still for the most part unprospected.
But here and there, as you know, the wealth has been
tapped, and last year (1909) British Columbia alone
yielded minerals to the value of nearly £5,000,000. So
far the Yukon has practically produced nothing but
placer gold, but it has produced about £25,000,000
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
worth of it. While partial development has taken place
along the international boundary line, and while some
of the main streams have been imperfectly prospected
for placer gold, the greater part of the Canadian section
of the Cordilleran Belt is as yet untouched. Probably
not a fifth has been prospected at all, not a twentieth
prospected in detail, and not one area, however small,
completely tested. The Belt in Canada is not merely
rich in gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc, but it has
enormous resources of excellent coal, varying from
lignites to anthracite. Only the coal areas in the
southern portion of British Columbia, and a few small
areas on the Telkwa and Nass rivers, and on the
Yukon, are at present known, but Mr. D. B. Dowling
estimates that the prospected fields represent, in the
Yukon, thirty-two million tons of anthracite, and the
same quantity of bituminous coal, and, in British
Columbia, twenty million tons of the former, and 38,642
million tons of the latter. Then, too, great unprospected
areas are known to contain, in places, coal formations,
and no doubt they will, when explored, add
greatly to the reserves I have just mentioned. So far,
production has not kept pace with discovery; but a
largely increased output may be expected in the near
future, for those regions supply the best steaming and
coking coals anywhere to be obtained in the West,
and new railways will facilitate distribution. Only
about one-fifth of Alaska has been explored, and lack
of transportation facilities hinders development there;
but already Alaska has a large production, which shows
that the Cordilleran Belt maintains its highly mineralised
character throughout its length.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, Mr. Brock,” I said, “there is another
matter about which I should like you to express your
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
views. How comes it that, when Canada possesses all
this mineral wealth, the English people have, in the
past, so often burnt their fingers in financing Canadian
mines?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very glad,” replied Mr. Brock thoughtfully,
“you have raised this question, which is of great importance.
Not all have burnt their fingers, but there
have been too many instances, some of them notorious.
You are thinking mainly, I presume, about events
that are rather more than fifteen years old—events
which resulted, necessarily but most unfortunately, in
deflecting British capital from Canada; though happily,
thanks to the lapse of time and the logic of facts, the
financial suspicion and sensitiveness then generated have
passed away. Of course in those affairs there were deplorable
elements for which Canada was in no way
responsible. One name in particular will be present in
both our minds; but, at this time of day, the personal
side of the matter need not be recalled; and I will only
say generally that we had nothing to do with the
ludicrous over-capitalising of good properties, and the
crippling process of establishing offices and staffs on
a scale which, though undoubtedly princely and imposing,
was, from the practical point of view, not merely
superfluous but ineffective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speaking generally,” continued Mr. Brock, “the
causes of non-success are bad investment, bad management,
and perhaps in some cases bad luck. There have
not been many bad investments by mining companies
that know what they are about, that employ experienced,
technical men to look over the field and closely examine
a property before purchase, and that move cautiously
and intelligently, doing their developments step by step.
It is quite common to see the investments made by men
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
who are not sufficiently competent or experienced to
form a sound judgment, or who do not carry out an
adequate personal investigation before effecting their
purchases. Sometimes it is very evident that knowledge
and training were not the qualifications that led
to their selection for such responsible work. It is by
the merest chance if those investments turn out satisfactorily.
Unfortunately, in every country, and in
Canada as elsewhere, there are people ready to profit
by such visitors. The knowing ones promptly take
their mental measure, learn what financial backing they
have, and very likely bait a trap for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In other words,” I could not forbear to observe,
“the innocent Englishman falls among thieves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said Mr. Brock quietly, “is a harsh but
not unwarranted way of putting it. However, a man
who is willing to buy a pig in a bag does not require
to leave home to find those willing to accommodate him.
I am prompted at once to say two things: in the first
place, the practices to which I refer are confined to a
small minority of a large and honourable class of men;
and, secondly, those who act in this way are actuated
by a belief that, where the wits of one man are pitted
against those of another, the keener party is entitled
to any advantage he can secure. These men are, you
must remember, born gamblers; and they lay themselves
out to win, not so much for the sake of the material
profit (they are mostly men of substance) as for the
sport of the thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fraud for fraud’s sake,” I interjected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please understand,” Mr. Brock again reminded
me, “that I am explaining, not exculpating, their conduct.
And, as a matter of fact, no resentment that
you can express at these miscarriages of capital can
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
equal the regret they excite among responsible people
in this country. For British capital is an important
factor in Canada’s development; and it is therefore
greatly to the interests of Canada that British capital
should, in all cases, be invested in mines that will pay
well, and thereby serve as a magnet for further British
capital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you,” I asked, “make the position clearer by
indicating the sort of meshes in which my unsuspecting
countrymen get entangled?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mr. Brock, “occasionally they are represented
by a man who pays too much attention to what
he is told. Such a man may travel over a good deal of
territory, meet a number of mining folk, and hear a
great deal about the exceptional merits of, let us say,
the M. Tee property, until he places an undue valuation
upon it, and is consumed by a desire to become its
possessor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so,” I exclaimed, “that most treacherous form
of conspiracy is considered by the guilty parties as
sport?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call it what you will,” Mr. Brock replied, “but the
interests of Canada, as well as of the English investor,
demand that a different type of representative should be
engaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another cause of non-success has been the time at
which British capital has been invested. It has come
in on the crest of a boom, a prospect being purchased
as, and at the price of, a mine. When the prospect
fails to develop into a mine—and only a very small percentage
of prospects can reasonably be expected so to
develop—one more investment is announced as a
failure. If prospects are invested in, the investors
should be prepared to take up a considerable number,
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
and only after careful selection, so that there may be a
reasonable chance of one of them developing into a
mine. The selection should be made on the best
possible technical advice, which should include the recommendation
of a reputable expert who has local knowledge.
The mining engineers of Canada are as intelligent
and reliable as those to be found elsewhere, and
they have their local reputations at stake and—I am
sure I can add—their country’s good at heart. That
expert local knowledge is the best insurance one can
have against an unfortunate investment. No matter
how tempting an option may seem, it should not be
taken up until there has been a personal investigation
by, and a favourable report from, an expert of professional
standing and local knowledge. When that
principle is more generally understood and acted upon,
Canadian mines will become reliable and prosperous
investments for British capital, instead of mere speculations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not altogether free from the wild-cat promoter.
There have been instances of properties being
purchased, without regard to their merit or lack of merit,
in a district that happened to be in the public eye, and,
following the appointment of a management calculated
to command confidence, the investor has been invited
to subscribe for stock. In the case of property purchased
in such a way, it would not be at all surprising
if the best management in the world should fail to
achieve success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of lavish and superfluous expenditure on home
offices I have already spoken. At the mine itself there
has also been, in some instances, a good deal of money
wasted on excessive plant and improvements—notably
on permanent works when only those of a temporary
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
character were warranted. This extravagance has resulted
largely from a want of familiarity with local
conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the worst mistake of all is to look after the
details of management in Great Britain. Efficiency is
impossible under those conditions. The management
must be on the spot. Put in a man with the requisite
knowledge and character and give him a free hand. If
his work prove unsatisfactory, dismiss him and get
somebody else; but so long as he is manager let him
act as such. Have a home man if you like as consulting
engineer. Let him go out and decide the general
plan of development; but give the local manager a free
hand in carrying out the campaign. Let the consulting
engineer inspect his work, and learn his reasons for
having run this cross-cut and that drift; let the consulting
engineer decide whether he is doing well or ill,
whether he is saving money or wasting it, whether he
should be retained or dismissed; but do not relieve the
local manager of responsibility. Do not have him work
on cabled instructions based on cabled reports and office
maps, and then expect efficient management and a successful
mine. If he needs assistance and advice he
needs them at the mine, and that is where he should
have them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those words, coming from the foremost Government
geologist of Canada, carry great weight; and I
hope Mr. Brock’s counsel will be taken to heart by
the City of London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now—not to close this chapter in a minor key—I
will glance briefly at Canada’s mineral production in
1910. It represented a value of £25,000,000, or rather
more than a 14 per cent. advance on the figures for
the previous year. Coal occupied the premier place,
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
with a value of, approximately, £6,000,000. Silver
came next (£3,420,000), while pig iron, nickel and
gold each yielded a total in excess of £2,000,000. They
were succeeded in the scale of value by copper and
asbestos.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span><h1 id='t7393'>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>NEW SASKATCHEWAN</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The story of modern Canada is a story of amazing
mistakes and delightful discoveries. At every stage
of development popular surmise has been made to look
foolish by the accomplished fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The statesman is alive who prophesied that if a
railway were ever built around Lake Superior it would
not earn enough money to buy axle grease.” So I was
informed by Mr. Arthur Hawkes, the genial publicist,
who added: “On my first visit to Canada in 1885 I
heard an Ontario man warning emigrants against going
so far into the wilds as Winnipeg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Saskatchewan, it was not so very long ago
when people shrugged their shoulders over that “frozen
and barren wilderness.” It was opened up by railways,
and behold Saskatchewan to-day as a smiling country
that is excelled for grain production nowhere in the
Empire. I learn that the agricultural produce of the
province has already reached an annual value of
£30,000,000, the total cereal crop for a year—according
to Government figures—exceeding 200,000,000
bushels. When one understands that this is the yield
from only twelve per cent. of the available arable land
of Saskatchewan, one begins to see grounds for the
prophecy, which has been uttered by Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, that the day is not far distant when Saskatchewan
will produce annually a billion bushels of grain.
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
And the curious fact has to be noted that the Saskatchewan
of all those figures and references is not
Saskatchewan at all, but only the southern half of Saskatchewan—the
half that has been opened up by
railways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What particularly struck me in travelling through
the province was that, when on the most northerly
margin of the settled country, I kept coming upon
farmers whose wheat and oats had won important
prizes. The farmers were disposed to think the fact
was sufficiently explained by their agricultural aptitude.
But I could not help suspecting that their terrestrial
latitude had a good deal to do with it. A six months’
Canadian summer is longer—from a plant’s point of
view—than a seven months’ Canadian summer. For
wheat and oats do not make much progress in the dark;
and the lengthening of the winters as one goes north
is, within a limit only to be fixed by experience, a
disadvantage of no account beside the advantage of
longer summer days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Settlement has probably not yet reached the ideal
latitude for wheat growing. At any rate, having
regard to the rapidity with which railways are extending,
the time has come when, to Canada and her prospective
immigrants, the possibilities held out by
Northern Saskatchewan have become a matter of eager
interest. I will therefore focus such meagre evidence
as is available on the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first witness we will call is the Venerable Archdeacon
J. McKay, who for forty-five years has been in
charge of Church of England missions in the West.
For a decade he lived on the Churchill River, a little
to the north of Lac la Rouge. Therefore he is in a
position to give us tidings of territory situated about
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
two hundred miles north of the limit of the surveyed
lands—territory, however, which is still within the area
of Central Saskatchewan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Archdeacon leads off with this appetising
fact: cranberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries,
gooseberries, and currants grow wild and abundant in
the district. He reports that there are plenty of trees
there, notably spruce and poplar, which are good for
pulp-wood if not very important as timber. At Lac
la Rouge he has seen good wheat raised for seven
years in succession without any trouble being experienced
from frost. Potatoes also grow there splendidly;
indeed, as the reverend gentleman put it, the locality
is “all right for raising anything that can be raised
anywhere in Saskatchewan.” He explained that if the
country were cleared of timber it would, in his opinion,
be fair agricultural land. With regard to stock, he
could merely say that he himself had kept, at the
mission on the Churchill River, fifteen head of cattle
and two horses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archdeacon McKay is also able to testify concerning
the Ile à la Crosse country, which lies in much the same
latitude as the area already alluded to, but some hundred
and sixty miles farther west. This is his instructive
summary: “Plenty of timber, and plenty of hay
as a rule—some prairie hay and some swamp hay—and
the soil is fairly good. It is better than at Lac la
Rouge, and it gets better as you go west.” Questioned
as to the wild grasses, he described them as “long,”
and as “very much the same as the natural hay in
Manitoba.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more we hear of prairie fires; and it would
seem that they have been particularly destructive in
the rocky districts. Cross-examined with regard to
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
timber possibilities, Archdeacon McKay recalled the
interesting circumstance that he himself had erected a
saw-mill, which was run by water-power, at Lac la
Rouge. He added these significant details: “The
logs average seventeen to the thousand feet, and are
fourteen or fifteen feet long. The diameter would be
about two feet across at the butt. They are large,
clean logs, very much the same as those at Prince
Albert. This good timber is scattered all over the
country, sometimes for miles.” Pressed to give a more
definite impression of the timber area, he said he
believed it extended right away to the borders of the
province. It appeared that he had travelled backwards
and forwards a good deal, “visiting Indian camps and
so on,” and he noted very much the same kind of trees
everywhere. Of course there are muskeg in some
places, and in others he saw “heavy timber.” Reindeer
Lake was the most northerly point he had reached, and
he saw plenty of trees up there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will now be of interest to learn what light the
Archdeacon can throw on the fauna of unknown
Saskatchewan. “In Lac la Rouge and the lakes generally,”
he said, “fish are abundant. They are mostly
white-fish and lake trout. The Indians do not sell
them; they have no market. For some time there
would be plenty of fish for commercial purposes. I saw
a lot in Reindeer Lake.” With regard to fur-bearing
animals, “sometimes they are on the increase, sometimes
on the decrease, but on the whole there is a decrease,
especially in beaver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archdeacon McKay gave some interesting details
with regard to climate. A peculiarity of the country
round Lac la Rouge, it seems, is that “the frosts are
very late.” On an island in the lake he has seen
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
potatoes growing in October, with the tops untouched
by frost. He imagines that the large body of water
serves to equalise the temperature; and he recalled the
interesting fact that when Mr. Chisholm, the Indian
inspector, came out one year to make treaty payments
to the natives towards the end of August, the potato
plants were unaffected both on the mainland and on
the islands, “and the inspector told me that crop was
a good deal touched at Prince Albert before he left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snowfall is not very heavy. Three feet on the
level, it appears, would be considered deep snow. As
a rule, the first frosts come in September. He had
known potatoes to be “touched,” but not seriously, on
the fifteenth of that month. As for the time of sowing,
grain could go in, as a rule, by May 5th. That was
the date on which the Archdeacon had been in the
habit of sowing wheat. He plants potatoes about fifteen
days later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Asked to give his impressions of the winter and
summer temperatures, once more he drew an analogy
between unknown Saskatchewan and a district in
settled Saskatchewan. “In winter,” he said, “judging
from my own sensations, the lowest temperature is
about the same as at Prince Albert. In the summer
time the weather is as hot as at Prince Albert. But,
of course, the country of which I am speaking is farther
north, and therefore the days are longer.” Of the Lac
la Rouge district he reports that, speaking generally,
there is sufficient rainfall for crops. One summer there
was quite a long spell of dry weather, and it affected
the wild fruits; but that was an exceptional state of
things. The rainy season is quite equal to Manitoba’s.
Thunderstorms and hailstorms occur, but not more
frequently than in the south.
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only whites in the country,” said the Archdeacon,
“are the Hudson Bay officials and traders. I
built the saw-mill to provide lumber for our mission
buildings and boarding school. The number of Indians
who take treaty money in that district is over five
hundred. They are Crees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion the Archdeacon pointed out that canoeing
and pedestrianism represent the only means of
reaching the desirable and productive region in which
for so many years he has resided. Naturally he is
anxious for a railway to connect settled Saskatchewan
with Lac la Rouge. “It is all level country,” he said;
“there would not be the slightest difficulty in constructing
the railway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will now turn to the evidence of scientific investigators.
Acting for the Federal Government, Mr. J.
Burr Tyrrell explored the vast tract of country between
Athabasca Lake and Churchill River—the country, that
is, lying north of the area with which we have hitherto
mainly been concerned. With Mr. Tyrrell was associated
that other distinguished and experienced geologist,
Mr. D. B. Dowling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Tyrrell reported that the country is generally
forested, though most of the timber is small black
spruce and tamarack. Banksia pine forms thin, parklike
woods on the sandy plains. In places berries
grow in great profusion, chief among them being the
common huckleberry and the small cranberry. The
former thrives in the deciduous woods along the
Churchill River, while the latter covers the dry slopes
from the Saskatchewan northward. The blue huckleberry
is found on the banks of Cree and Stone Rivers,
but the bushes did not seem anywhere to bear much
fruit. The raspberry occurs on the richer ground by
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
some of the streams. The yellow swampberry is found
abundantly in the moss of the wet spruce and tamarack
swamps. On drier land towards the north he found
the crowberry, while the Pembina berry grows in the
deciduous woods beside the streams, especially in the
southern portion of the district.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/img-200.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0028' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>A CORNER OF MONTREAL HARBOUR, SKETCHED FROM CUSTOMS HOUSE</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>These explorers saw the moose, the barren ground
caribou, the Canadian lynx, the grey wolf, red, black
and cross foxes, the wolverine and the skunk. The
black bear roams over the whole country. A few
beavers may still be met with in many of the streams.
The rabbit or American hare is found everywhere in the
denser woods. Porcupines are plentiful around Cree
Lake, and in those portions of the sandy country that
have not recently been hunted over by Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The time at our disposal,” said Mr. Tyrrell, “did
not permit us to make a close examination of the birds
seen, but, generally speaking, except along the banks of
the Churchill River, where ducks breed in great numbers,
birds are not at all numerous in the district explored.”
Coveys of ruffled grouse and spruce partridge were
found in the thicker woods everywhere. A few snowy
owls and bald-headed eagles were observed. Fish
seemed to be everywhere abundant in the lakes and
streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The number of Indians who live in and travel
through the country, obtaining a precarious existence
by hunting and fishing, is,” we learn from Mr. Tyrrell,
“very small.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To quote another authority, Professor John Macoun
(the well-known naturalist of the Geological Survey)
said: “There can be no question about the value of
the land north of the Saskatchewan, and settlers going
in there are assured of three essentials—wood, water,
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
and hay—for cattle.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;. The low altitude and the
long day are fixed conditions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With reference to altitude, I may point out that
Prince Albert is nearly five hundred feet lower than
Regina, and that the Lac la Rouge district is two
hundred and sixty feet lower than Prince Albert. Regarding
the duration of sunlight, a careful record was
made, over a period of four months, as to the relative
length of day in the district under consideration, at
Prince Albert and at Ottawa. Taking a date at random
(June 20th), the figures were, respectively, 17 hours
30 minutes, 16 hours 42 minutes, and 15 hours 26
minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion, let me briefly refer to the experiences
of Mr. Frank J. P. Crean, who was specially commissioned
to explore, in 1908 and 1909, the huge areas of
Saskatchewan and Alberta lying north of surveyed
limits. Mr. Crean reports that those northern countries
are “capable of producing large quantities of cereals and
farm produce and of supporting a large population. The
over-abundance of water and lack of natural drainage,
causing large swamps and muskegs, might, in my
opinion, be easily remedied by clearing out some of the
rapids on the Churchill River and providing outlets
for the surplus water where natural outlets are lacking.
Very little work would be necessary to open fine waterways
navigable for small craft throughout the country.
.&ensp;.&ensp;. The climate seems well adapted for raising
any cereals. In fact, wherever wheat has been tried it
has been grown successfully.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;. I would estimate
that an area of fully 5,000,000 acres is suitable for
settlement as soon as surveyed and made accessible by
roads; and an area of about 12,000,000 acres of swamps,
or land probably too wet at present for successful
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
cultivation, could be reclaimed at a moderate expenditure.
.&ensp;.&ensp;. In the south-easterly portion the soil is good, being
a light loam, with a blue clay subsoil; towards the west
the land is light loam with a sandy clay subsoil.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;. Of
course the winter is cold, but not any colder nor longer
than the winter in some of the settled portions of Saskatchewan.
In August, 1908, a frost occurred almost
all over the settled parts of Saskatchewan, but did not
apparently affect the northern portion which I explored.
.&ensp;.&ensp;. I was at Portage la Loche on September 17th, and
the potato tops were not frozen in the least. The
garden was also quite untouched. Cabbages, carrots,
parsnips, etc., all looked well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everywhere Mr. Crean found an abundance of hay.
In places the meadows were small, but always numerous.
Among the chief birds he saw were swans,
geese, ducks, partridges, gulls, jays, kingfishers, crows,
robins and loons. He noticed that the staple food of
the native north of the Saskatchewan is fish, with
which he is abundantly provided. “North of the
Churchill,” Mr. Crean reported, “lies a district of great
promise from a mineral point of view.” Finally, we
learn, “there are many points where a large amount
of water power could be developed.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span><h1 id='t7723'>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>INDIANS AND THE MISSIONARY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The presence of the red man in Canada—and, for the
matter of that, in the United States—has put the white
man’s capacity and character to a searching test. I refer
to the white man of the modern world, for the attitude
of our ancestors towards the Indian was controlled by
different contemporary conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here were some belated representatives of prehistoric
man—human beings without culture or conscience, and
who, but for a superior resourcefulness, seemed on a
plane with the brutes of the field. By arms this wild
people had easily been tamed. But from that moment
they became a political and social problem with which,
though it well might prove insoluble, obligations of
humanity compelled the Government of Canada to
grapple, without stint of effort, money or patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could these quelled savages be civilised?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Worldly wisdom shook its head, and hope had
nothing but faith to rest upon. The Red Indian had
inherited no higher ideal of conduct than the slaughtering
and scalping of tribal enemies—men, women and
children—and self-mutilation as a stimulus to personal
bravery. True, those practices were now prohibited by
the whites—by that mysterious, masterful race who had
brought fire-arms and fire-water into the Red Indian’s
life.
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Vaguely I knew of the missionaries who labour
among the Indians and Eskimos, their lives consecrated
to the work which holds them, from year to year and
decade to decade, outside the range of public knowledge
and recognition. I sought through the mind of one of
those missionaries to peer into the Red Indian heart,
so that my readers might be able to judge, from definite
testimony on crucial points of human character, whether
Canada’s aborigines are fitted to survive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My visit was to the Rev. Canon H. W. G. Stocken
(of the Church Missionary Society), at the Blackfoot
Reserve near Gleichen, Alberta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Archdeacon Tims came out here in 1883,” said
Canon Stocken, “and I came out in 1885. I was under
Archdeacon Tims until 1888, and since 1895 I have
been in charge of this mission. In the early years the
outlook was dark. We sowed, and there was no visible
harvest. It was difficult to reach the hearts of the Blackfeet.
They had been fearless, fierce and successful
fighters, and there seemed no room in their minds for
beautiful and holy thoughts. Unlike other Indians,
they even had no hope of ‘Happy Hunting-Grounds.’
Their barren imaginations only pictured aimless, restless
wanderings on adjacent sand-hills after death.
With dread and in a spirit of propitiation, they worshipped
the sun, the moon, the earth, and the water.
For them the weasel, the eagle, the crow, the otter, and
the beaver were sacred, and they wore the skins and
feathers of those creatures as charms. Thefts, murders,
and crimes of all sorts were lauded if the penalty were
escaped; and preservation from the penalty was invariably
attributed to the protecting influence of some
charm. Unlike Indians of the north and the east, the
Blackfeet knew of no Great Spirit. There was no hope
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
in life, no hope in death, for that poor, unhappy people,
whose God was their belly, whose glory was in their
shame, who minded earthly things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, through the schools, it proved possible
to make some progress with the Blackfeet children.
But I felt that, here as elsewhere, the work of reaching
the adults was of supreme importance. Hoping against
hope, we took all opportunities to try and illumine the
minds of the chiefs, the braves and the squaws. For
fifteen years with heavy hearts we laboured. Then on
a sudden came our abundant reward. It was in the
early spring of 1898. The schools, the hospital, the
preaching, the conversations from time to time—all
those influences yielded fruit in the day of blessing
when we witnessed the birth of the Spirit among the
Blackfeet. I will tell you what happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For some time we had succeeded in attracting a
few Indians to our Sunday services—merely a handful,
among whom the only regular attendant was a
young man named Kaksakin, which means ‘An Axe.’
One Sunday I was walking from the schoolroom, where
the service had been held, and proceeding slowly towards
the mission-house. I had been discoursing on
the life of St. Paul, which had been the theme of my
sermons for several months past. The old, old question
was running in my mind—when would the great change
come to my people? As I walked a hand was placed
on my shoulder, and, turning, I found that three
members of my congregation had followed me. Young
Axe was one, Pukapinni (‘Little Eyes’) was another,
and Pukapinni’s brother Matsenamaka (‘Handsome
Gun’) was the third. Young Axe was the first to
speak. He told me of his desire to become a child of
God and to be baptised. Then the others said the
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
same: and my heart leapt when I saw the eager sincerity
on their faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those two brothers had come originally to our
services at the eager persuasion of Axe. Curiosity and
ridicule clearly engaged their thoughts at first. But
the satirical smiles had gradually died away, and of
late they had listened as earnestly as Axe himself. But
of what was passing in their hearts I had no knowledge
until that ever-memorable Sunday afternoon.
Little Eyes poured forth the story of a dream he had
had. In that dream he entered the school porch, and
was standing by my side as I rang the bell for the morning
service. Suddenly he saw a spiral staircase passing
up far out of sight. I asked him to come with me up
the staircase, and he consented, so that presently we
ascended far above the earth, and came at last to the
top, where a lovely country spread in every direction.
In that dream I asked what he thought of the sight
before him, and he said it was more beautiful than
anything he had ever seen before. I urged him in the
dream never to forget what he had seen, and then I
bade him to descend again. ‘I did so,’ he said,
‘trembling very much, but reached the earth in safety.’
That was the end of the dream. He said God had
sent it to him, and he wanted to obey His voice and
be baptised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, Canon Stocken told me, was but the beginning.
A great spiritual awakening had come to the
Blackfeet, and for some time the reserve was in a state
of strange unrest. Many had dreams, which were
deeply impressive as told to the missionary by those
awed and child-like Indians. For some time he lived
amid marvels and mysteries, not knowing what new
wonder the hour would bring forth. At first, indeed,
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
he was frightened and in a great uncertainty, scarce
daring to hold to the hopes those manifestations put
into his mind. Yet it did not seem incredible that
matters should shape themselves thus, and not otherwise,
when into the darkness of heathendom there first
came spiritual light, leaving the Indian dazzled,
bewildered, exalted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Following those first conversions,” said Canon
Stocken, “we had about twelve weeks of careful, individual
preparation, and on March 27th, 1898, the first
five adults were baptised, receiving the names of Paul,
Daniel, Timothy, Thomas, and Ruth. From that time
there were crowded congregations at the services. I can
never forget those wide-open, straining eyes. No more
impressive sight can any man see than the faces of
heathen who begin to realise that there is something
outside of themselves. The most solemn and wonderful
time I think I ever experienced was on the evening of
Easter Sunday. In the morning I had said, in dismissing
my congregation, ‘Now, to-night I’m going to
have a special service in the mission-room for those
Christians who want to understand more about the
Resurrection, and I’ll tell you of all the appearances of
Christ that are mentioned in Scripture.’ Every one of
the Christians came, besides some heathen, among
whom was the wife of our Axe. She was very angry
with him for becoming a Christian. She had refused
to go to the service. But he made her come. Thinking
of Constantine’s method, he was going to put the sword
into force, so she yielded. Neyer shall I forget the
awful, death-like stillness as those men and women
strained their whole being, so to speak, to take in the
subject of the Resurrection. You could positively have
heard a pin drop on the floor. I was trembling all
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
over at the responsibility of telling them those things
which now they heard for the first time. I concluded
with a short prayer, and then I went out to put my
surplice in an adjoining room. Before, however, I had
taken it off that woman came rushing in—the wife of
Axe, I mean—and cried aloud: ‘Mokuyomakin, I do
believe! I very much believe! I believe the teaching
of God. I want you to baptise me also.’ The upshot
was that she became a most earnest Christian. My poor
wife used to say that, apart from Naomi (and I will tell
you about Naomi later), there was no one in her
women’s class upon whom she could lean more confidently
than upon Esther, which was the name given
in baptism to Axe’s wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked Canon Stocken to elucidate the Indian name
by which Esther had addressed him. “Mokuyomakin
means Running Wolf,” he explained. “The Indians
christen everybody, you know. It was an old chief
who dubbed me Running Wolf soon after I arrived.
The words have no personal application to myself.
The old chief said it was the name of a friend of his
who had lately died, and for whose loss his heart was
heavy. I considered he was paying me a real compliment,
and I have always felt very proud of my
name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Stocken next told me about Little Eyes,
who figures on the Government list as Paul Little
Walker. His father, it appeared, was Bull Backfat,
who was head chief of the Blood Indians and a famous
warrior and hunter. “When Little Eyes was only
four years old,” said the canon, “Bull Backfat was
killed, accidentally or otherwise, by an Indian. The
boy was then brought here by his mother, whose name
was Little Walker, and he became one of the most
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
conspicuous lads on the reservation. I have told you
of the dream that led to his conversion. He was
thirty-one years of age at that time. He received the
name of Paul at his baptism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be difficult for me,” continued Canon
Stocken, pondering his words, “to make you realise
the simple earnestness and sincere devotion that have
characterised that man’s life down to the present day.
I would like first to say that many and many a time
he has helped me spiritually. There have been occasions
of stress and sorrow when, following a long and
exhausting day, I have sat alone at my desk in such
an extremity of physical weariness that, when a knock
has come at the door, I have been tempted to disregard
the summons rather than have my rest disturbed.
Sometimes Paul has proved to be the visitor, and each
time, in a little while, his words and thoughts have
lifted my oppression and renewed my strength, leaving
me very grateful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon after his conversion he was going among
the heathen Indians one Sunday morning, as came to
be his custom, and trying to persuade them to attend
the service. Among those to whom he spoke was the
wife of one of his uncles—a woman bitterly hostile
to Christianity. ‘No, no,’ she indignantly replied, ‘I
won’t be seen inside your church. I don’t believe in
your God,’ and she jumped up and got her tanning
knife and started to tan. Paul said: ‘This is God’s
day. It is not the will of God that we should work
seven days. Our bodies need a rest, and to-day it is
our duty to worship.’ Then he walked away. But
he had not gone many steps when he heard a scream,
and, turning round, he saw the woman lying in convulsions
on the ground. ‘Go away,’ she cried, when
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
he stepped up to her; ‘your God has done this.’
‘Done what?’ he asked. ‘Broken my knife in half,’
she replied. And then he saw that the blade of the
tanning knife had snapped. ‘I do not know if God
did this,’ Paul quietly rejoined, ‘but you had better
learn a lesson from it.’ And, as a matter of fact,
though that woman never became a Christian, she was
ever afterwards respectful about Christianity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, you will notice, is not superstitious. One
day, soon after his conversion, we were talking about
Indian charms, some specimens lying before us. ‘If
there was anything in them,’ Paul said simply, ‘they
would jump up and help me to have a better temper.’
He was a little hasty and liable to fits of anger, I
should mention, until he learnt to conquer the weakness.
Indeed, several people told me that he had
been, as they put it, a very tough sort of fellow. How
different to the later Paul—the present Paul!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He devises his own ways of doing good, but
always with modest diffidence. One day he came to
me in anxious sorrow and said: ‘What is right?
What ought I to do? There is Owl Voice over there,
and he is angry with his wife. Some Indians have
gone to him and said she has behaved as a bad woman,
and I fear he will take her life before sunset. The
chiefs are there, and the camp is quite excited. What
I want you to tell me is—What is my duty? May I
not go and try to bring peace? ‘I said ‘Yes—what
else could you do?’ Paul looked relieved; but he
showed me how the uncertainty had come into his
mind. ‘I asked Axe first,’ he explained, ‘and at once
Axe said: “We believe in Christ and God, and we
do what is right. But those heathen people are different.
Let them alone.” But I then said to Axe:
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
“By what we hear about Jesus Christ, I think He
would go and try to make peace.”’ I said to Paul:
‘Go, please, by all means; and I do hope you will
be successful!’ He went; and the sequel I heard
next day from one of the chiefs who was present—Big
Road, who became a Christian later on. Big
Road came to me and said: ‘This young man of
yours is a wonderful fellow.’ I said: ‘Why?’ He
said: ‘We have never seen anything the same as this
in our lives. We all like him.’ I said: ‘Tell me
of it.’ Big Road said: ‘He came into the tent yesterday,
and went up to Owl Voice and held out his hand.
Then he stepped up to Owl Voice and kissed him, and
said “My brother, I’ve come to you as a friend, as a
servant of the God above us, because I believe that
Jesus Christ would do what I am trying to do if He
were here. I want to restore peace between you and
your wife. I want to tell you that I don’t believe
one word of what you have been told about your wife.
I want you to say you will forgive your wife what
you thought was wrong, and that you will let her come
to you, and you will kiss her in the presence of these
chiefs, and say it is all right.” Owl Voice looked on
the ground and was silent a long time. Paul continued
to speak to him, and said: “Well, my brother,
you will do what I ask? Let me bring your wife to
you that you may kiss her.” At last Owl Voice
looked up in your young man’s face, and said: “Well,
I believe you are right.” Then the young man went
and took the girl by the hand and brought her to Owl
Voice, and said: “Now, kiss her.” Owl Voice looked
up and kissed his wife, and said: “It is all right.”
Then he turned to the chiefs and said: “You can all
go,” and they went.’ ”

<p class='caption'>SUN DANCE OF BLACKFEET INDIANS</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Stocken told me next about Old Wolf
Collar, the veteran who once was a mighty warrior, a
great hunter of the buffalo, and the “medicine man”
of paramount fame and influence in the tribe. “When
he became a Christian, in March, 1899,” the missionary
related, “Old Wolf Collar was nearly sixty years of
age—older than any other man I had baptised. At
that time, as I afterwards found, he had not given his
whole heart to Christianity. He had been impressed
by religion as the power that made white men lead
good lives. He had become a Christian for the sake
of material advantages. Well, one day I was trying
to make my congregation see that if Christianity were
anything at all to a man, it went right down into his
inmost life, and he must cherish no evil thoughts and
attempt to keep no secrets from God. That caught
Old Wolf Collar; and he came to me in sorrow,
bringing a collection of the charms that had been part
and parcel of his former distinction as a medicine-man.
At his conversion he had surrendered a number
of such things into my hands, and I had not suspected
that he was keeping some back. Full of penitence,
he now said he did not know the religion of God was
so searching. ‘I’ve still got these things,’ he said.
‘Take the whole business,’ and he handed me all those
charms, some of which I afterwards sent to the museum
at Banff, others going to England. Having unburdened
his conscience in that way, the dear old
fellow breathed more freely. ‘Now, go ahead,’ he
said, ‘and tell me all the things you know about God.’
From that time Old Wolf Collar has been full of zeal.
You will have heard that the one trouble with the
Indians is that they are lazy. But Old Wolf Collar
is not lazy. In those days we had Miss Collings with
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
us, and at his eager request she taught him to play
the auto-harp, and she taught him the syllabic system.
I ought to tell you that these Indians had no literature
of their own. They had to depend solely upon memory
for their knowledge—a fact, by the way, that made
the missionary’s responsibility a very heavy one, since,
if there were any laxity on his part in presenting a
truth, the consequent misconception in their minds
went uncorrected by the printed Word. That danger
has largely passed away with the dissemination of the
syllabic system, whereby the Blackfoot language is
reduced to terms that the hand can write and the eye
can read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Wolf Collar proved a quick pupil, and as
soon as he had obtained a tolerable mastery of the
system he got together of an evening some ten or
twelve young Indians, to whom he imparted his new
knowledge by writing the characters again and again
on a large sheet of paper. It was good work well
begun; and to-day, I think, there isn’t a single family
on the reservation that has not at least one member
who can read and write the syllabic. With the aid
of the system, Old Wolf Collar taught, and partly
prepared for baptism, several men to whom I had
seldom, if ever, spoken personally; and when he
thought their preliminary instruction was sufficient,
he sent them up to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will give you an idea of what the old man’s
faith was like. But first you must know that originally
he had two wives, and when he became converted he
put one away, providing for her, and married the
other by Christian rites. He won all his family to
Christianity; and then a series of terrible bereavements
befell him. First, one of his two daughters
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
died, then his only son, after that his second daughter,
and finally his wife, so that the old man was bereft
of all who were near and dear to him; though, presently,
with my concurrence, he married the wife he
had put away, and she is still spared to him. What
I was going to tell you was this: At the time of his
heavy bereavement I visited him one day, when he
took his pipe from his mouth and said: ‘Why is it,
do you think, that a man, when he becomes a Christian,
should have sorrow and trouble which he never had
before? Before I became a Christian I had all my
family complete, and I had no sadness. Now I have
all this trouble to bear. What is the reason?’ I said:
‘You are not the only one who has asked that question.
There are lots of problems that we cannot solve. But
do you remember what I was teaching you about
Abraham?’ ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘you mean about offering
up Isaac? Ah, do you think that’s it?’ I replied:
‘I’m not saying it is. I don’t know. I’m just asking
you to bear it in mind.’ ‘If you think God is testing
Old Wolf Collar,’ was his reply, ‘He won’t find I
will go back on Him.’ Old Wolf Collar is a minor
chief, and he exercises his authority wisely, like Running
Rabbit, the gentle old fellow of seventy-four who
at present occupies the supreme position.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of young men, Canon Stocken explained,
the conferring of high tribal rank sometimes reacts
prejudicially on character. In this connection he told
me more about Axe, to whose personality he had already
afforded some clues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young Axe,” he said, “used to talk more than
others about the Holy Spirit, but I could see he didn’t
grasp it, and I wished he wouldn’t. He was constantly
producing his copy of the Scriptures in the
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
Blackfoot Roman characters, and saying, ‘I will read
it. That is hard for us to do.’ He was very conceited,
but very clever—in fact, he had learnt the book by
rote. He used to get hold of the bishop, and say:
‘I want you to come here and sit down and hear me
while I read this.’ And very soon he would begin
dogmatising. I remember once the bishop made a
very useful remark. Axe had said to him: ‘What
do you think, Bishop—wouldn’t it be a good thing if
I found out all the evil that is going on in this reserve,
and let you know?’ ‘No, thank you—don’t,’ said
the bishop. ‘But why not?’ persisted Axe. ‘How
can we get rid of it unless we get to know about it?’
‘Well,’ said the bishop, ‘did you ever happen to
notice that you’ve got two parts to your eye—an eye
and an eyelid? Did it ever occur to you that God
gave you eyes and eyelids so that you should see some
things, while others are shielded from your vision?
We are not to go about and search for our brother’s
faults. If they are discovered, we must help our
brother.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Axe was of very powerful physique, and one
day when he was engaged in carrying logs, he came
to me and said: ‘Running Wolf, those of us who
work very hard need whisky.’ I said I did not think
God ever made any constitution that required whisky.
‘I know God does,’ insisted Axe; ‘and if you do
the right thing you will keep whisky here and dole
it out to me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Government offered a present of so many
head of cattle to those Indians who cared to take them
and commence ranching. Axe very promptly stated
his readiness to accept as many as he could have; and
I think the Government gave him twenty. The chiefs
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
were in a great state, because they thought the Government
would stop the rations, and would believe that
the Indians, now they had accepted cattle, would be
self-supporting. When the commissioner next visited
the reserve he gave through me a message to Axe. It
was that the Government were very pleased with him
because he had taken cattle and given up gambling,
and, therefore, the Government wished to make him a
minor chief, and to give him a present of a cook’s
stove. He was trying to patch up his old stove at
the time. Axe said to me: ‘Why do the Government
look among the boys’—he was about twenty-six at the
time—‘to find a chief?’ I said: ‘Partly because
you’ve done what they wish, and you’ve shown the
sort of spirit that they desire to encourage; and partly
because, being young, you are likely to be energetic in
doing their wishes.’ He said: ‘I think it is a mistake
looking to boys for chiefs.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few months afterwards the commissioner came
along and appointed two new minor chiefs—namely,
Axe and Calf Bull, who was another young and progressive
Indian. Axe very soon began to show his
importance. He felt that, since the Government
wanted him to carry out their wishes, it would, of
course, be the right thing to suppress evil. He was
anxious to use compulsion and violence in recruiting
the Church membership, and he was so troublesome
about it that someone from the south camp went to the
Indian agent and said that Axe was trying to make
people Christians by force, and at my instigation!
His own attendances at church, I am sorry to say,
have fallen off since he became a minor chief, and he
has not been to Holy Communion for two years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the conversation reverted to Paul, who, I
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
learnt, has preached the Gospel among his people with
untiring zeal and remarkable success. He had an early
trial, it seemed, in his young wife’s indifference to
Christianity. “She fell grievously ill,” Canon Stocken
related, “and we had her brought into our house, a
parlour being turned to account as the sick-room,
where Paul and the invalid’s mother took it in turns
to watch by the bedside. One night the dying woman
had a beautiful dream, and when she awoke in the
morning she said: ‘Your changed life, Paul, and what
God has shown me in a dream, have made Christianity
real to me, and I’ve made up my mind to become a
Christian.’ It was a great joy to Paul and to all of us;
and on the following Sunday (May 20th, 1898) she
was baptised. We had a solemn little baptism service
in our sitting-room. My wife had a dear friend from
Japan staying with us, and she helped. The poor
invalid, though very weak, insisted on getting up.
Her Indian name was Pretty Nose. We baptised her
Sarah. When Paul was leading her back to bed, he
stooped down—she was a short woman—and kissed
her, and said: ‘Never mind; it won’t be for long; we
shall meet again.’ She did not live long after that,
and when the end came she spoke very cheerfully of
her hope in Christ and her freedom from fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About two months later Paul had a dream that
deeply impressed him. He was sitting alone in his
brother’s house, reading in the syllabic, when he must
have fallen asleep, for a vision came to him of a figure
standing in the open doorway. It was that of a young
woman wearing a loose yellow garment, which was
caught together at the neck with a brooch that sparkled
like a star. Her hair fell over her shoulders, and her
face was radiant. She smiled and said: ‘Paul, don’t
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
you know me? Don’t you know your own wife?’
He jumped up to seize her hand, and she continued:
‘God has sent me to you because He loves you, and
He bids you to persevere. Do not be in doubt about
me, for I am very happy.’ Then she vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” continued Canon Stocken, “I must tell
you about Naomi, who is Paul’s present wife. She
was the widow of Black Boy, who was Big Road’s
brother. One day she said to me: ‘My husband, Black
Boy, had wanted to become a Christian, but he was
never asked by a missionary.’ It was sad to hear this
when Black Boy was dead; but I had made it a rule
never to ask any Indians to become Christians. There
was always the fear in my mind that they might consent,
not through any earnest desire on their own part,
but because they wished to please. It has always
seemed to me that one must teach them all one can,
and point out the evil of sin, but that the actual request
for baptism must come unprompted from their own
hearts and lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Black Boy had been dead six months or
so, Handsome Otter Woman—that was the name of
his widow—said to me: ‘Running Wolf, if I marry
again, I’m going to marry a Christian.’ Later, she
said: ‘Paul is the man I want to marry.’ Paul had
said: ‘I’m never going to marry again; I’m just going
to work.’ She kept sending messages to Paul to say
she would like to marry him; and Paul eventually
agreed, because his brother Timothy was so keen for
it. Indian marriages are usually arranged by relatives,
the principals having very little voice in the matter.
Thus, a mother or father will say to a chief: ‘My girl
is old enough to be married. Whom do you suggest?’
The chief might say that So-and-So would make a good
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
son-in-law. Then the question would arise: How many
horses might the girl’s parents expect from the family
of the suggested husband?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After Paul and Handsome Otter Woman were
married, their tempers rather clashed. Paul would
come round to my house, and be very silent, and then
say: ‘H’m! My wife has gone away.’ ‘What is
the matter?’ I would ask. ‘She gets most dreadfully
cross,’ he would tell me; and then take his departure.
In a little while his wife would be sure to arrive, and
explain: ‘Paul is so dreadfully cross, you know.’
‘Yes,’ I would point out, ‘we all have our failings;
but we must learn to control ourselves. You can do
so if you try.’ After one or two little tiffs of that sort,
they settled down to be a most affectionate couple. In
the work of spreading Christianity among their people,
they now labour hand in hand, helping and stimulating
one another. After she was baptised—receiving the
name of Naomi—it was her eager wish to become a
Bible-woman. In those days she could not read the
syllabic system; but she would not let that temporary
disability stand in the way of her work. She got me
every week to prepare brief notes of some truths, and
these she caused to be read over and over to her until
she had the words by heart. In that way she entered
upon labours to which she has since devoted her life.
Naomi’s teaching, sympathy, and self-sacrificing ministrations
have indeed been a blessing to the Indian
women on this reserve.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>What need of further evidence? The red man is
revealed as in all essentials like unto the white man,
with a conscience responsive to the knowledge of good
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
and evil. Great profit has crowned the self-sacrifice of
the men and women who have devoted their lives to
Canada’s aborigines. To a triumphant end have the
C.M.S. and other bodies endured anxieties and sustained
the financial burden. Human blessings now
reward the self-denial of their devoted subscribers.
Already in the Indian reserves missionary effort is
giving place to ministrations purely pastoral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the present state of Fenimore Cooper’s
scalping savage, two words remain to be spoken. The
missionaries having made him a Christian, the Government
is making him a farmer. It has been up-hill
work, necessitating much thought and patience, a large
staff, and heavy expenditure. But at last the red man
is successfully growing fruit in British Columbia and
raising grain and stock in the Prairie Provinces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to one matter, however, still his mind urgently
needs enlightenment. He must be taught the paramount
importance of thoroughly ventilating his dwelling,
alike in the winter and the summer. For, alas!
the tribes suffer a heavy mortality from consumption,
whereof the preventive and cure is fresh air.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span><h1 id='t8375'>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>NORTHERN ALBERTA</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>That part of Saskatchewan (more than half the province)
lying north of occupied, or at any rate surveyed,
territory, I have been tempted to describe as “Unknown
Saskatchewan”; and certainly the clues we possess to
its character are slight, even though they carry a
definite and comprehensive assurance of the country’s
suitability for settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the northern half of Alberta, the word
“Unknown” would be comparatively inapplicable. In
this case chance has, I find, provided us with a good
deal of information. Nay, as will be seen, we have
clues to agricultural possibilities in regions far to the
north of the northern boundary of Alberta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is strange how persistently the public imagination
goes astray concerning matters of latitude. Nine years
ago I found Calgary shrugging its shoulders over a
city called Edmonton, situated some two hundred miles
to the north. Daring pioneers up there were understood
to be making praiseworthy efforts in the direction
of grain-growing; “but no, sir,” a farmer of the Calgary
district solemnly assured me, “it isn’t reasonable to
suppose crops’ll growth that far north.” It will, I
think, be superfluous to mention that last year, on
visiting Edmonton—healthy, handsome, and sunny
Edmonton (which is between 53° and 54° latitude)—I
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
found the district producing immense quantities of the
best quality hard wheat that averaged over twenty, and
sometimes reached forty, bushels to the acre. “You
see,” as a local expert pointed out to me, “the Edmonton
district is just right for growing things. Everything
is in our favour. We’ve got much longer days than
people have in the south. Why, at midsummer the sun
is shining for eighteen hours a day, and that lets the
crops go ahead fine. Then, too, we’re particularly lucky
in having such wonderful, rich soil. Added to that, we
can always count on enough rain—and not too much.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>EDMONTON: EAST END OF JASPER AVENUE</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Those complacent words applied to the district immediately
north of Edmonton—in other words, to what is
practically the limit of settled Alberta. I will now
invite the reader to ascend a sort of ladder of latitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our first short stride takes us to an old post on the
Lesser Slave Lake, which is nearly two hundred miles
to the north-west of Edmonton, the line of latitude
(which is the special matter that concerns us at the
moment) being something less than one hundred and
fifty miles to the north. I find travellers and missionaries
unanimous in testifying that wheat, oats, barley,
potatoes and various kinds of vegetables are grown
to perfection at Lesser Slave Lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now mount to Dunvegan (lat. 55.9°), about fifty
miles further north (and one hundred miles to the
west), concerning which place we learn from the Rev.
D. M. Gordon that, on going there in 1880, he found
a great variety of vegetables growing, including cucumbers;
while he was informed that wheat was raised
at the post as far back as 1828.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another northward step of about fifty miles brings
us (far away in eastern Alberta) to Fort McMurray (lat.
56.7°), on the Athabasca River; and concerning Fort
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
McMurray it is recorded that “Professor Macoun, on
the 8th of September, 1875, saw tomatoes, cucumbers,
wheat and barley under cultivation, together with all
vegetables found in kitchen gardens of Ontario. He
spent ten days there, and obtained specimens of wheat
and barley which have astonished everyone to whom
they were exhibited. Many of the ears contained one
hundred grains, and the weight of both wheat and
barley was nearly ten pounds above the ordinary weight
per bushel. These grains had been raised on soil comparatively
poor—very poor for the district—and lying
only a few feet above the level of Lake Athabasca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So here we are over two hundred miles to the north
of Edmonton, and reports of vegetation tend to become
more, instead of less, satisfactory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next we jump an interval of about a hundred and fifty
miles, and pause at Fort Chipewyan (lat. 58.7°), where, I
learn, Professor Macoun obtained in 1875 fine samples
of wheat and barley, the former weighing 68 lbs. to the
bushel and the latter 58 lbs. He learnt that at a French
Mission, two miles above the Fort, oats, wheat and
barley were all cut by the 26th of August. But a still
more remarkable fact has to be recorded. The Rev.
D. M. Gordon was in a position to say that samples of
wheat and barley raised at Fort Chipewyan were sent to
the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, where
they won a medal in open competition with the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us take a further stride, to a point some two
hundred miles further north—to Fort Providence (lat.
61.4°). Here we are about one hundred miles north
of the northern boundary of Alberta; and perhaps this
is as good a place as another to mention that the province
of Alberta is considerably larger than France or
Germany. Please note how far we have travelled—Fort
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
Providence is over seven hundred miles north of Calgary.
And what do we find at Fort Providence—Polar
bears and perpetual frost? Not a bit of it. Listen
to this quotation from a report by Mr. Elihu Stewart,
who, as superintendent of forestry for the Dominion
of Canada, visited those northern lands in 1906: “On
July 15th, the garden at Fort Providence contained
peas fit for use, potatoes in flower, tomatoes, rhubarb,
beets, cabbages and onions. Besides vegetables, there
were cultivated flowers and fruit, such as red currants,
gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries and saskatoons.
But most surprising thing of all was a small field of
wheat in the milk, the grain being fully formed. This
was stated to have been sown on May 20th, and it was
harvested before July 28th—slightly over two months
from sowing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, the marvellous potency of the long days of sunshine.
What a rush there will be for the Great North
Lands—that agricultural El Dorado—when the world
understands their value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No further evidence is, I think, needed; but, by way
of completing the ascent of my “ladder,” I will invite
the reader to move in imagination some thirty miles
nearer the North Pole, to Fort Simpson (lat. 61.8°)—the
most remote point from which I have been enabled to
glean any gardening news. Mr. Hardisty, the late chief
factor in charge of the Hudson Bay post, told Mr.
Macoun that melons, if started under glass, ripened
well there, frost seldom doing them harm. Barley, Mr.
Hardisty added, always ripened at Fort Simpson. Another
witness is accessible in the person of Mr. William
Ogilvie, the explorer. “While at this post,” he reported,
“we enjoyed the fine potatoes, carrots, parsnips,
cabbage and peas grown in the Hudson Bay
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
Company’s garden. They were as large and as fine
flavoured as the best in any part of the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The facts being as I have stated, no wonder some
enterprising pioneers have “gone in advance of the
railway,” and settled in that part of the Peace River
district lying around Lesser Slave Lake and to the
west of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>News of the high farming value of the Great North
Lands will, I think, come upon the public as a surprise.
Yet, as has recently been pointed out by Mr. R. E.
Young (Canada’s Superintendent of Railway Lands),
the truth of the matter has for long been demonstrated
inferentially by the experience of another quarter of the
globe. On a map of Western Canada, Mr. Young has
superimposed the highly productive Russian province
of Tobolsk, in its accurate position as to latitude; and,
behold! the main southern boundary of Tobolsk occurs
(on the map of the Dominion) a good deal north of
settled Southern Alberta, while northern Tobolsk extends
right up the Canadian mainland, crosses Coronation
Gulf, and spreads some way over Victoria Island.
Recent statistics about the Russian province are not
available to me; but in 1906 it was supporting a
population of over a million and a half, in 1907 it
was producing 30,770,000 bushels of wheat, rye,
barley and oats, it raises many million head of livestock,
and from one district alone (Kurgan) there was
exported in 1902, largely to Great Britain, 19,711,446
lbs. of butter. I may add, on the authority of the
British Blue Book from which the last-named figures
are taken, that dairy-farming in Tobolsk promised, at
the date of publication (1905), a marvellous development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I have already mentioned, certain enterprising
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
and discerning mortals have gone into the productive
North Lands ahead of the locomotive. Mr. Alfred Von
Hamerstein, for instance, who was on his way to the
Klondike in 1897, changed his mind, and opened a
store at Athabasca Landing. He traded with the
Indians, and it is interesting to learn that his customers
were keen to buy different kinds of seeds; so he added
flower-seeds to his stock, “and some lovely flowers were
raised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards he made extensive explorations up and
down the country, and took up with mining and with
petroleum-boring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Asked about the Peace River Valley, Mr. Von
Hamerstein said it is “a good country for agricultural
settlement—as good as any country in Alberta.” He
described both the Athabasca and Peace River regions
as “marvellous for the growth of small wild fruit,”
adding: “At the end of July, or the first part of August,
there are strawberries, followed by raspberries and blueberries.
Then come the saskatoons, choke cherries, white
plums and berries of every description. They are found
all over the country and they all have a very nice flavour
indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this gentleman’s experiences I take the following
interesting facts: He has seen trees in the neighbourhood
of McMurray that would make 1,000 feet of
timber. The missionaries and natives catch a quantity
of fish, including a creature called the “inconnu”—the
unknown—which weighs from 40 to 50 lbs. Sometimes
on a walk of fifteen miles he has seen as many as twenty
or thirty bears, which are quite harmless. The long
list of Alberta quadrupeds includes the wolverine—a
gigantic skunk with stripes on his back and known out
West as “the devil.” Among the birds are several
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
varieties of the eagle, a little wild canary, and the Canadian
jay, commonly called “the whisky jack.” Along
the northern boundary of Alberta, around Salt River,
the cariboo, the moose and other game congregate to
lick the salt, “and there are quite a few buffalo” to be
seen. Ducks and geese assemble around Lake Athabasca
in enormous numbers, “and when killed their
stomachs are found full of cranberries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Von Hamerstein has done a good deal of gold-mining
in the Athabasca and Peace River districts.
“I took out gold,” he said, “at a little bar right opposite
the mouth of the Lesser Slave River in the Athabasca.
I worked it for part of two summers. I would take
out enough to last me for the winter and then quit. It
is hard work.” He mentioned that the Indians have
“gold and diamonds on the brain,” and they have
brought him “rocks containing very nice garnets, but
they were very mysterious about them.” He explained
that there is “very good gold-mining” on the Peace
River, a little below Battle River. “But the gold is so
very fine that for every dollar you save there, about four
and a half go away.” He also referred to many good
seams of coal, and mentioned that one season, at Fort
McKay, he “took out about twenty tons right on
the river bank.” It was a good quality of bituminous
coal. At McMurray “150 feet of salt was found,” and
the Hudson Bay people “come down and take it with
shovels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to natural gas, Mr. Von Hamerstein
ventilated a grievance of the backwoods. It seems that
an experimental bore-hole at Pelican Portage struck “a
very large volume of gas, and the well has never been
plugged.” He considered it an actual sin to leave it like
that, as “the gas has now been escaping for eleven
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
years.” It is robbing the whole district of gas that
might be used in the future. It seems that the Government
prospectors who made the well were boring for
petroleum. The tremendous flow of natural gas interrupted
their work. They left the gas alight, and returned
to the spot in the following year, hoping the
flow would by that time be exhausted. Instead, they
found it still burning; so they went away, and never
returned; and during the eleven years that have since
elapsed it has continued to burn. Once when Mr. Von
Hamerstein went there, the column of flame was 40 feet
high; afterwards he found it had been reduced to 18
or 20 feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mentioned that he has expended more than
£12,000 in “punching holes through the ground.”
There is no doubt in his mind that “petroleum will be
found all through the country from Athabasca River
to the Peace River.” It seems that, in connection with
their prospecting, mining and boring operations, Mr.
Von Hamerstein’s parties use a good deal of natural
gas. “We light our camps with it,” he said, “and do
our blacksmith’s work with it, and it comes in very
handy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Von Hamerstein remarked: “As far as petroleum
is concerned, I have all my money put into it,
and there is other people’s money in it, and I have to
be loyal. As to whether you can get petroleum in merchantable
quantities, that is a matter about which I
would not care to speak. I have been taking in
machinery for about three years. Last year I placed
about $50,000 worth of machinery in there. I have
not brought it in for ornamental purposes, although it
does look nice and homelike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He explained that there are sulphur beds and springs
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
between McMurray and Lake Athabasca, and on the
Clearwater River first-class medicinal springs. “It is
a very nice, picturesque country,” this interesting witness
added, “and the natives go up there and doctor
themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often the miner, and sometimes the farmer, enters a
territory before trains have superseded the canoe and
the ox-wagon; and in our chapter on Northern Alberta
we have glanced at the romantic life of a pioneer who,
if lacking modern means of access to his market, has
a delightfully free hand to tap the overflowing natural
resources of the landscape surrounding him. A finer
career that, I think, for young and muscular manhood
than the daily sitting on a stool in smoky London City.
But it is for the adventurous, resourceful, self-contained
men who need no companions but their own healthy
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is another and more popular phase of pioneerdom—that
of the early settlers in a district which the
railway will reach, not some day, but soon; and in
this connection—let me add in a warning parenthesis—one
thinks of bachelors with energy and forethought
rather than of middle-aged men with nerves and a
family. The farming forerunner is apt to figure in a
few years as the “old-timer” with a big balance at
the bank and some stories worth listening to. And note
that, when he has made good progress with his tillage,
the construction gangs of the on-coming track will
pay high rates for his accumulated store of grain,
besides offering him opportunity to earn substantial
wages with his horses, his pick and his shovel.
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I need attempt no enumeration of the railways being
laid in Canada To-day, and to be laid in Canada To-morrow.
But I will write about two of them, and
about regions they will open up, since the information
may well serve the reader’s personal interests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An earlier chapter showed how the construction of
the Canadian Pacific Railway put a belt of prosperous
civilisation across Canada. There is still only that one
completed trans-continental line within the Dominion.
But two others are in progress—two others that promise
national advantages comparable with those that followed
the making of the C.P.R. The one project—the Grand
Trunk Pacific—was deliberately conceived under
Government auspices; the other—the Canadian
Northern—sprang spontaneously from the brains of two
sagacious men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 1888 to 1896 no railways were constructed in
Western Canada. During that period the country was
“catching up,” in the matter of development, to the
magnificent transit facilities provided by the C.P.R.
In 1889 there was a promise of new transportation
enterprise, powers being granted to a “Lake Manitoba
Railway and Canal Company.” But for seven years
its charter remained unused. Meanwhile, east of Lake
Manitoba, a premature beginning was made with a
railway to connect Winnipeg with Hudson Bay—the
momentous development which as explained in an
earlier chapter, is now about to occur. The next fact
to be noted is that the inhabitants of Western Canada
included two men—Mr. W. Mackenzie and Mr. D. D.
Mann—who had helped as contractors to construct the
C.P.R., and who, sharing an enthusiastic faith in the
prairie country, became business partners. They took
over the dormant charter, and made a line into the
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
Dauphin Valley; and such was the humble birth of
the great system subsequently to be christened the
Canadian Northern. The fortunes of that company are
to-day guided by Sir William Mackenzie and Sir
Donald Mann, acting in association with Mr. D. Blyth
Hanna, who was in charge of the initial line from Gladstone
to Dauphin, which was inaugurated in December,
1896.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last-named gentleman is indirectly responsible
for the following record of an incident in the early life
of a great undertaking: “A train on which he happened
to be travelling to Dauphin ran over a heifer
and broke her leg. On the train also were a couple of
butchers on their way to a construction camp at the
then terminus of the line. Mr. Hanna stopped the
train, had the butchers kill and dress the heifer, whose
carcase, thirteen minutes after the accident, was loaded
in the baggage car, and was presently sold to the contractors.
The hide was sent to Winnipeg, the farmer’s
claim was paid in full, and a profit of four dollars and
sixty-five cents included in the first balance-sheet of the
railway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the past fourteen years the Canadian
Northern has grown at the rate of a mile a day. To
the east, the Manitoba capital was linked with Port
Arthur, and of the 1909 crops the Canadian Northern
carried over 37,000,000 bushels to the head of navigation.
The expansion of the system in the plains is
proceeding upon a plan destined to result in five principal
lines running east and west of Winnipeg, with
certain north-westerly deflections that will feed the new
Hudson Bay route. The Canadian Northern, indeed
is now opening up an acreage of land no less fertile,
and more extensive, than that which has given Manitoba
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
and Southern Saskatchewan their pre-eminence in
wheat-growing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The British Columbia Government guaranteed
bonds up to £7,000 per mile to secure the expansion
of the Canadian Northern from Alberta to the Pacific
coast. On the passing last year of the sanctioning Act,
construction was promptly started from the mouth of
the Fraser River at New Westminster, so that, as
provided by the statute, British Columbia shall receive
its second direct communication with the Prairie Provinces
in the year 1914—the year of the proposed
World’s Fair at Winnipeg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Canadian Northern Pacific will ascend the
Fraser River cañon to the Thompson River, which it
will follow to Kamloops. Thence it is to strike north-westerly
through the valley of the North Thompson,
reaching Edmonton by way of the Yellowhead Pass,
which is the easiest route through the Rocky Mountains.
From Edmonton the track is already advancing
to meet the British Columbia section.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deflecting from Fort Frances, two hundred miles
east of Winnipeg, the Canadian Northern has entry to
Duluth, the principal United States port on the Great
Lakes; and therefore the Pacific extension will afford
connection between Puget Sound and Duluth on a
mileage almost identical with that of the Northern
Pacific—the pioneer railway across the north-western
States—with the advantage that, whereas the Northern
Pacific has to climb three summits (of which the highest
is nearly 6,000 feet), the Canadian Northern Pacific has
to climb only one summit (a mere matter of 3,700 feet).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The project for connecting the head of Lake Superior
with Canada’s eastern coast was undertaken piecemeal.
By far the greater part of that distance has been covered,
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
and, as I write, remaining gaps are being surveyed.
To the question, “When will the Canadian Northern
extend as an unbroken system between the Atlantic and
the Pacific?” I have received this answer: “A very
few years will see completion.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>BUILDING THE G.T.P.R.: THE TRACK-LAYING MACHINE AT WORK</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the Canadian Northern, following the
example of the C.P.R., has inaugurated a superb trans-Atlantic
steamship service between Bristol and Canada.
A fleet of steamships on the Great Lakes is also controlled
by the company that owes its greatness to the
genius of three men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, incorporated
by an Act of 1903, is under agreements with
the Federal Government for the construction and operation
of a railway, wholly within Canadian territory,
extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Its main
line is to be of an estimated length of 3,600 miles, and
there will be several branches of considerable length
and importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This system, while traversing what is believed to be
the richest mineral region of Eastern Canada, will open
up an attractive area of Quebec Province and pass along
the great clay belt in New Ontario (where a section
has already been constructed, in connection with the
Provincial Government’s line that affords access to the
rich silver and nickel districts).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the prairie section lying between Winnipeg
and the Rocky Mountains, Professor Thomas
Shaw, formerly of Ontario Agricultural College, remarks:
“The lands are of three kinds. They may be
classed, first, as having special adaptation to the production
of grain; second, as having such adaptation to
mixed farming of which live-stock will form an important
feature; and, third, as being mainly adapted to the
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
production of live-stock only. The third class is not
very large, the second is much larger, and the first is
by far the largest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The splendid native grasses,” observes Mr. E. S.
Bayard (editor of <span class='it'>The National Stockman and Farmer</span>),
“the good grain, the apparently favourable conditions
for the growth of alfalfa and other clovers, peas, vetches
and barley, and the abundance of water, all look good
to a man who is interested in live-stock.” “The country
pierced by the Grand Trunk Pacific in the Canadian
West,” we learn from Professor E. E. Faville (editor of
<span class='it'>Successful Farming</span>), “presents opportunities not to be
excelled in any part of Canada.” And this is the testimony
of yet another agricultural editor: “Conditions
along the Grand Trunk Pacific are generally suitable
for grain-growing, including a rich soil, reinforced with
a vast quantity of vegetable mould, a sufficiency of
rain during the planting and growing season, bright
sunshiny days during the ripening season (hastening
maturity), an absence of rust (due to the dry period
at time of harvest), and an apparently total absence of
all insect pests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In May, 1906, Professor J. Macoun, of the Government
Geological Survey, received instructions to make
an inspection of the country, on both sides of the line,
between Portage la Prairie and Edmonton. From his
report I take the following facts:</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the land from the Assiniboine westward to
Touchwood, and over twenty miles beyond, is more or
less covered with timber, although there are often great
stretches of prairie interspersed with it. Ponds,
marshes, rich bottoms and numerous lakes are scattered
without order throughout the country. Everywhere the
soil is rich—chiefly black loam. At the Indian mission
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
near Touchwood, Mr. Macoun found excellent wheat,
and in the garden at the post all the vegetables were
of the highest quality. There is practically no bad land.
On these extensive prairies, the settler’s first work is
the erection of a turf house and the digging of a well;
then he is established. South of Tramping Lake, many
houses could be seen. The settlers met with were invariably
from the United States, and all seemed pleased
with their prospects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I may mention that the company, who have no agricultural
land for sale, published last June a list indicating
the situation of 8,000 free homesteads available
along the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the mountain section (which is now being
rapidly pushed forward from both the east and the
west), the country it traverses is said to be unequalled
in North America for natural resources. Where the
conditions do not lend themselves to agriculture, there
is mining or lumbering to be developed, and in the
rare districts in which those possibilities fail, there is at
least trapping and hunting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Last year I spoke with members of a party who,
on behalf of the company, had just traversed the railway
route across the mountains. On the beauty of the country
they could not sufficiently dilate. At Yellowhead
Pass, they said, you enter a vast, wild, unsubdued
Alpine wonderland. It has been dedicated for ever to
the use of the nation as the Jasper National Park—an
expanse of indescribable grandeur, with an ocean of
majestic virgin peaks comprised within the numerous
well-defined ranges, snow-capped and glacier scored,
which tower above a continental watershed wherein are
the headwaters of five mighty rivers—the Saskatchewan,
the Athabasca, the Thompson, the Columbia, and the
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
Fraser. Also I heard of forest-clad slopes, flower-strewn
passes, impressive solitudes, vast snow-fields and exquisite
lakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far above the explorers’ heads was Roche à Miette—an
imposing, sphinx-like head with a swelling Elizabethan
ruff of sandstone and shales. To the east the
party saw a cluster of mineral springs, two of which
boil out of a mountain side in a wild secluded little
valley, and have a temperature of 116 degrees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farther on they saw Mount Geikie towering inaccessible,
its summit lost in azure at a height of
11,000 feet. To the south-east lay Simpson’s Pass, in
which the mighty Athabasca is born in a region of perpetual
snow and a succession of glaciers. Within that
pass is the “Committee’s Punch Bowl,” whereof Sir
George Simpson has written: “The relative position
of the opposite waters is such as to have hardly a correlative
on the earth’s surface, for a small lake sends its
tribute from one end to the Columbia and from the
other to the Mackenzie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently they arrived in sight of Mount Robson,
the King of the Rockies, which had been recently scaled
by the Rev. G. R. B. Kinney, of the Alpine Club of
Canada. Impressions of that eminence must be given
in the words of its hero. “The first party of white
men (of which I was one),” says Mr. Kinney, “ever
known to reach Mount Robson was organised by Dr.
Coleman, of Toronto University.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;. Our first camp
was in the deep shades of the cedar and hemlock on the
Grand Forks, within a mile of where the branch coming
in from around the north of the mountain joins the
one from around the south. Because of my roving disposition,
I became the explorer of the party, and my
first discovery was that of the beautiful lake that bears
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
my name. Nestling at the very foot of Mount Robson
on the west, walled in on every side by majestic glacier-bearing
peaks, this forest-fringed emerald gem, sentinelled
by the highest and grandest mountain in all the
Rockies, will rival Lake Louise for splendour. The
feeling of being the first white man known to walk its
shores, and looking for the first time on the glories
of its brand-new wonders, filled me with a sense of
awe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party failed to climb Mount Robson in 1907,
so they returned to the task in the following summer,
when again their efforts were unavailing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing in 1909 that an American party were about
to seek the coveted prize, Mr. Kinney got together a
pack train of three horses and three months’ provisions,
“and left Edmonton alone to capture the mountain,
hoping to pick up a companion on the trail.” At the
place where he swam his horses across the Athabasca,
he fell in with Donald Phillips, a young Ontario guide,
and enlisted his companionship. They worried their
packs to an altitude of about 10,700 feet, where they
succeeded in making a bed on a snow-covered shelf.
“For hundreds of miles,” says Mr. Kinney, “the peaks
lay at our feet. Scores of miles of the Fraser valley
lay open below us like a map, and the mighty Fraser
was but a tiny, crooked thread of silver. Then the
valleys disappeared, and we were alone with the stars
and the snow-white peaks and the grinding avalanches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friday, August 13, dawned clear and cold, and
by the time the sun rose we were on our way to the
peak. The many cliffs we had to climb were only from
ten to a hundred feet high, but those hard, smooth, icy
slopes between were tipped at an angle of from fifty to
seventy degrees. One slip on the part of either of us
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
meant a fearful slide to death thousands of feet below.
The storm-clouds of sleet swept down and engulfed us
while we were at little more than eleven thousand feet
altitude. We had not enough provisions for another
two-days’ climb. This was our last possible chance, and
we despaired of ever reaching the peak. Fortunately,
though the clouds were very dense and cold, but little
snow fell. The storm was a blessing in a way, for
though it spoiled our chance of getting pictures, it
shut out of view those fearful sheer slopes below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In five hours of steady work we reached the peak.
The clouds broke open for one brief minute, revealing
to us a wonder world, with the Fraser more than eleven
thousand feet beneath us; then the storm swept in
worse than ever. It took us seven hours to return to
our ‘highest-up’ camp, so dangerous had the softened
slopes become on account of the storm, and by the
time we reached our camp in the valley the climb had
cost us twenty hours of hard work—but we had finally
captured Mount Robson for our country and the Alpine
Club of Canada. Our provisions were gone, we were
hundreds of miles from civilisation; so for two weeks
we lived on what mountain-gophers and birds we could
get. I finally reached Edmonton September 6th, only
to find that Cook and Peary monopolised the interest
of the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, to continue our progress towards the Pacific,
I learn that, seventy-five miles from the sea, there occurs
a marvellous palisade of corrugated and terraced mountains
reaching a height of 6,000 feet. Then comes a
cañon one mile long with sheer walls a hundred feet
high; and through that majestic avenue flows a mighty
torrent. And so we continue along the Skeena River—a
valley of enchantment—until we reach the new ocean
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
port (Prince Rupert) that will be created by the Grand
Trunk Pacific.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Situated 550 miles north of Vancouver, and forty
miles south of the Alaska boundary, Prince Rupert
occupies a beautiful site, and, it is said, nature has
provided that future city with the finest harbour on the
Pacific coast—large, land-locked, with deep water, no
shoals, and an absence of strong tidal currents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steamship services from Prince Rupert will shorten
by two days the traffic between Europe and Asia. To
this new port will come the ships of the Seven Seas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To compare the production of a small but old country
like Great Britain with the production of a large but
new country like Canada is to find oneself confronted
by comic statistics. For a beginner, the daughter is
doing very well with her large farm of nearly four
million square miles; but the mother is doing so much
better with her mere potato patch of 121,000 square
miles, that the two sets of results, when placed side by
side, almost smack of Gilbert and Sullivan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True, the daughter has got ahead in wheat-growing,
and also in timber (the old lady, in the latter case,
having allowed her stock to run low). But in other
matters the result is controlled by the greater number of
hands at work on the potato patch. In comparing the
results achieved by forty-five million people in a little
country, with the results achieved by eight million
people in a large country, we perceive what the political
economist means when he says wealth is labour. In
the making of wealth, natural resources are necessary.
They are the bases on which human effort builds. But
natural resources without population are of no immediate
value. To the starving, isolated man half a dozen
penny saveloys would be greater riches than a mountain
of gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the most recent reliable figures accessible
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
to me at the moment of writing, the fisheries of
England and Wales (leaving Scotland and Ireland out
of the reckoning) represent a greater annual money
value than the fisheries of Canada—a fact that assumes
considerable significance in the light of two other facts,
namely, (1) that the fisheries of Great Britain have been
severely depleted, and (2) that the fisheries of Canada
are the largest and most prolific in the world. Great
Britain, it will be noted, is the richer in caught fish;
Canada is the richer in uncaught fish. In other words,
Canada has more fish than Great Britain, but Great
Britain has more fishermen than Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remarkable results secured by the old lady—to
revert to the personal metaphor—are due to a comprehensive
thoroughness of effort. Her luggers go in fleets
to all the sandbanks—their trawls search each estuary
that is likely to harbour a pair of soles or a pint of
shrimps. At low tide the old lady examines her mud
shores for every wet and glistening periwinkle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The daughter is not in a position to do that. Her
staff of helpers is wholly inadequate to cope with all the
occupations and opportunities that crowd upon her.
With so many fisheries available, the only ones that
get attended to are those that shout for notice. The
fish would not get caught unless they practically insisted
upon it. British Columbia salmon assemble in
such myriads in certain of the rivers that their protruding
backs, at times, make a dense mat of fish
from shore to shore, almost hiding the water. That
statement may look like an exaggeration to the Englishman
accustomed to angle all day and secure, peradventure,
a couple of small roach as the reward of his
patient industry. But the statement describes an actual,
familiar sight; and, indeed, the natural resources of
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
Canada scarcely lend themselves to exaggeration.
Again and again I have seen and heard those natural
resources not over-stated, but ludicrously under-stated.
The mistake is constantly made, if quite unintentionally,
by Canadians themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me give another instance of a Canadian fish
that assembles in force, refusing to be overlooked. I
refer to the humble herring. “In 1903”—to quote unimpeachable
testimony—“the run of herring was very
large. At Nanaimo the fish invaded the harbour in such
numbers that thousands were washed up on the beach,
like seaweed, by the waves created by passing
steamers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, the waters of British Columbia
are alive with halibut, cod, flounders, anchovies, whales,
sardines, shad, oysters, clams, crabs, seals, prawns,
and other useful creatures that are more or less neglected
by a sparse and preoccupied human population. One
of the few fish that happens to receive careful, not to
say minute, attention in British Columbia is the sturgeon.
It is caught, esteemed, and, as I am officially
informed, subdivided into commercial uses according
to the following classification:—(1) caviare; (2) isinglass,
made from the swim bladder; (3) the flesh—fresh,
salted, smoked, or otherwise prepared; (4) oil,
which is of great value in the leather industry; (5) fertiliser,
made from entrails and scrap; (6) the soft,
gristly backbone, with its sheath, which, prepared, is
called wesiga, and in Russia is a popular article of
diet; (7) the brain and nerve cord, which, when smoked
and dried, is considered a great delicacy in China; (8)
the back portion of the sturgeon, or dorsal region, is
made into balyki; (9) the ventral part, or belly, of the
fish is utilised as a food called pupki; (10) a valuable
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>
glue, differing from the isinglass of the swim bladder,
is derived from the nose, fins, tail, etc.; and, lastly
(11), leather is made from the tough and dense skin.
Thus there is apparently no waste in the case of this
all-round fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the famous British Columbia
salmon, the first fact to be noted is that they are not
salmon. They are very like salmon, and they are as
good as salmon, if not better; but they do not belong
to the genus. In thinking otherwise the pioneer population
of British Columbia made one of those little
mistakes that are natural and excusable in the excitement
of occupying a new country. The fish in question
belong, as a matter of fact, to the genus oncorhynchus,
of which there are five species, all represented in British
Columbian waters—the sockeye, the spring, the coho,
the dog, and the humpback. When a mistake of this
sort has a sufficiently long start, the correction cannot
overtake it. The fish that are not salmon are now
recognised as salmon all over the world. Were you to
ask your grocer for “a tin of oncorhynchus,” you would
probably make him jump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another fact has to be noted in connection with the
great so-called salmon industry. Its historian has not
yet put in an appearance. I made that disappointing
discovery while talking with Mr. W. H. Barker,
president of the British Columbia Packers’ Association,
than whom, I had been assured, no man in Canada
knows more about the catching and canning of oncorhynchus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly would make an interesting book,” said
Mr. Barker thoughtfully, “but that book has not been
written.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to write it,” his visitor pointed out.
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m much too busy,” Mr. Barker declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, do please spare just one hour for the purpose
now,” was my appeal; and getting ready a notebook,
I explained that my shorthand would probably
be a match for his conversational speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To start at the beginning, then,” said Mr. Barker,
courteously falling in with this scheme for imparting
reliable information to the reading public, “you must
know that the pioneer was William Hume, who came
from the State of Maine, where his father, a Scotsman,
was a fisherman on the Kennebec River. In the early
’sixties William Hume, probably as a result of the gold
excitement, migrated to California, where he located on
the Sacramento River, and engaged in hunting and
fishing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An interesting memory of those days has to do
with an extraordinary gun that had been specially
made for him. It was of unusually large bore, and it
took a very heavy charge of powder—altogether an
extremely effective weapon against ducks and geese,
of which Hume and his partner shot a great many.
But one slight drawback to this gun was that it ‘kicked’
pretty badly, and its owner was always very careful
before firing it to protect himself with a thick shoulder-pad.
Well, one day Hume went off with a wagon-load
of birds for the market, leaving his partner in the shack
laid up with rheumatism. It seems that the invalid
came limping out into the air, and happened to see a
flock of geese. Without a second thought, he took
up Hume’s gun, quite forgetting about the shoulder-pad
and equally forgetting his own infirm condition.
He fired. How many geese he killed I don’t know, but
he himself was knocked sprawling, and on picking
himself up he made the delightful discovery that the
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
rheumatism had completely left him! I have seen that
gun in a museum. It certainly looks formidable enough
to ‘kick’ an unwary marksman off his feet. As to the
rest of the story, I merely repeat what I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William Hume caught more salmon than he could
dispose of—which unsatisfactory state of affairs he discussed
with a man he had known in Maine. This was
Mr. Hapgood; and the upshot of their deliberations
was that they jointly set to work, with make-shift
arrangements, to pack salmon in tins on a scow on the
Sacramento River. Such was the beginning of the
canning industry that has since assumed such gigantic
proportions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the following year Hume and Hapgood
migrated to the Columbia River, locating themselves
on the Washington side, about forty miles above
Astoria. There they started a cannery, packing four
thousand cases the first season, the fish being put up
in one-pound tins 4½ inches high. They had great
difficulty at first in finding a market. A good deal
went to Australia and to San Francisco, and the price
realised was twelve dollars a case. The demand grew
rapidly; other canneries were opened; and Hume’s
brothers came out from Maine to go into the business.
The brothers were George W. Hume (who is still
alive, and a very wealthy man), R. D. Hume, and Joe
Hume. Each started a cannery of his own; and R. D.
Hume’s “Crown” brand came to be very well known in
the old country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything was extremely crude at first. The
cans were imperfectly packed, and many had to be
thrown away. In those days all the processes were
done by hand, whereas now, of course, machinery
operates throughout.
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Humes were practical fishermen. As a boy
I worked for one of the brothers, and so I am able
to speak from personal knowledge. The fish were,
and still are, caught in what are called ‘gill nets.’
These are made from a linen thread known as shoe
thread. We used to make the nets ourselves, spinning
the twine and using from seven to twelve strands, which
we twisted up lightly. With weights at the bottom
to keep them down, the nets hang from cotton lines
attached to cedar floats. They drift with the tide, and
the fish, swimming up the river, thrust their heads into
the meshes and then cannot extricate themselves, owing
to the twine catching in their gills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fishing is rather hazardous. It takes place
at the mouth of the river, off the sand spits, where
the water is usually in great commotion. Very good
boats are used, but they are often capsized, a number
of fishermen being drowned every year. Each boat
carries two hands—the net man, or captain, and the
boat puller. It is nothing unusual for a boat to capture
in one night from two to three hundred large fish varying
in weight from 25 lb. to 28 lb. This is the fish
that is known on the Fraser River as the ‘spring,’
on the Columbia River as the ‘chinook,’ and in
Alaska as the ‘king.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In 1876 Alexander Ewan started below New Westminster
to can the salmon of the Fraser River. These
are a different variety, their local name being the ‘sockeye.’
They are without doubt the finest of all salmon
for canning, being of a uniform red colour and having
red oil. Their flavour is even better when they are
canned than when they are eaten newly-caught. The
sockeye is much smaller than the spring, running to
a uniform weight of six or seven pounds. On the
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
Fraser River, therefore, the fishermen use a smaller
net, made of finer thread, only five or six ply, the mesh
being six inches instead of nine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such was the success of the first cannery on the
Fraser that fifty have since been erected between New
Westminster and the Gulf of Georgia. The season’s
pack on the Fraser has been as high as one million
cases, each case containing 48 lb. of salmon. One
million cases would contain from twelve to fourteen
million fish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Barker then referred to the illusory fears some
persons in the Old Country have entertained on the
subject of tinned salmon: “There have,” he said,
“been instances of ptomaine poisoning in connection
with various animal foods, including canned fish. But
it has been proved on incontrovertible evidence, and
to the satisfaction of the highest scientific and medical
authorities, that canned fish is absolutely innocuous,
and very wholesome, when eaten fresh. The process
of canning it sterilises it. Ptomaine poisoning is
caused by the prolonged action of the air on food that
has been hermetically sealed, such as shell-fish,
sausages, and canned or bottled foods. We have paid
a lot of money to find that out. I will give you a
typical instance—a case of poisoning in New Haven,
Connecticut. We engaged one of the leading doctors
of the New York Health Department to go there and
investigate the circumstances. He found that when the
tin was opened—in the middle of July, with the thermometer
at nearly 100°—only a small part of the fish
was eaten. The rest was left in the tin, and was not
consumed until three days later, when this stale food
caused one child to die and made two or three others
sick. Cases investigated in Chicago and other parts
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
of the United States have had a similar history.
Canned salmon should be used only on the day the
tin is opened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked Mr. Barker to describe the processes to
which the fish is subjected in the cannery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the first place,” he explained, “a machine takes
off the heads, tails and fins, splits the fish open, and
removes the entrails, then brushes and washes the fish
inside and out. One machine will deal with twenty-five
thousand salmon in a day. Afterwards they go into
another apparatus, where they are scraped thoroughly
with a knife, while fresh, clean cold water is running
on them. Next they go into a bath of water, where
they are scrubbed thoroughly with a brush made to
fit the fish. Afterwards they are deposited on a revolving
frame and cut into slices, which exactly fit
the tins, into which they are subsequently inserted with
a small quantity of fine Liverpool salt. The filled tins
travel on a belt to automatic scales, which throw out
any that are light weight, the others proceeding on to
a machine which, having closed each tin, cleans the
outside with hot water and steam. The lids are now
crimped to impart strength, and then the tins are run
through a flux and rolled through the hot solder, which
sets on a subsequent journey along a twenty-foot belt,
the process being assisted by a jet of water. A stay
in the coolers is followed by a hot-water test for defective
soldering, after which the cans are conveyed to the
retorts and cooked, under pressure of steam, for from
half an hour to three-quarters. On leaving the retorts
they are vented—that is, a hole is opened in the can
to allow gases to escape. A drop of solder having
been dropped on that hole, there is a second cooking
process, to soften the bones and sterilise any air that
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
may remain in the tin. Finally the tin is washed,
lacquered (to prevent rusting), and labelled.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“You have some very clever machinery,” I remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Barker. “But it is all going
to be altered in the near future. The new way of canning
does away with soldering, the lids being fixed
by crimping—that is, by overlapping the joined edges
with such exactitude that the junction is absolutely airtight.
This year” (1910) “much of the California fruit
is being packed that way. Why the innovation affected
that industry before it reached the salmon canneries
is easily explained. The heat of the soldering copper
was apt to candy the sugar in the syrup, making it
dark and sometimes causing black specks, which looked
like dirt, to settle on the fruit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does soldering involve any similar disadvantage
in the case of salmon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But soldering necessitates skilled labour,
while crimping is done by machinery. That is why
we are compelled to make the change, which will put
the canneries to very heavy capital expenditure. Skilled
labour is becoming scarce and very dear. We have
a great many Orientals in the canneries. Chinamen
are most reliable and painstaking: they are good
mechanics, they don’t strike, they don’t get drunk,
and they are specially adapted for the work that has
to be done in a cannery. Previously their labour was
cheap, but now that the Government has imposed a
head tax of five hundred dollars on every Chinaman
who comes into the country, their labour has become
dear. One reason why the work does not attract
English labour is because it is not constant. The
heavy part of it occurs from July 20th to August 25th,
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
though, of course, the making of the cans takes place
before then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I well remember when the Chinese first started.
I worked then for a man named John West, who had
a little cannery on the Columbia River. George W.
Hume was the first man who hired Chinamen. He
was forced to do so because of the lack of white labour
and the unreliability of what he did get. In order to
keep sixty or seventy men for two or three months he had
to engage from three hundred and fifty to four hundred,
because they kept leaving, and they were constantly
getting drunk or striking. They were largely runaway
sailors and men of that class, who just drifted around,
earning a few dollars here and a few dollars there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You took your share,” I suggested, “of the actual
practical work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said the president of the Packers’ Association.
“Besides making nets, I fished and lent a
hand in all departments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt,” I further suggested, “there were some
interesting human characters in the salmon fisheries
in those days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was Lighthouse Sam for one,” Mr. Barker
answered. “They called him that because he had
once worked in a lighthouse. He was the most reckless
man I have ever known, and always getting into
trouble. Again and again his boat was capsized and
several of his partners were drowned; but Lighthouse
Sam seemed to have a charmed life. I well remember
the day when one of our men came running in—it
was Phil Williams, from Orkney Island—and shouted:
‘Lighthouse Sam is gone at last!’ Then he told us
that the poor fellow’s boat was pitching about, bottom-up,
in the breakers, and that both hands were drowned.
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
It seemed that he had left two men trying to rescue
the boat—which they did not succeed in doing until
an hour afterwards. Then they made an amazing discovery.
Lighthouse Sam was underneath, and,
although exhausted, quite unharmed, there having
been enough air in the bottom of the boat to keep him
alive. His mate, as usual, was drowned. After that,
I am sorry to say, Lighthouse Sam took to drink, and
in the following year he stole a boat, and, securing
a partner, sailed up the Pacific coast to do a little fishing
on his own account in Shoal Water Bay. The
wind blew strongly from the south-east; they were in
danger of being swamped, and the reckless mariner
headed straight for the shore, undeterred by the sight
of heavy breakers. The boat was smashed to pieces,
the partner was duly drowned, but Lighthouse Sam
got safely ashore. After that he was put into the
penitentiary for stealing the boat, and I lost sight of
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the by, Lighthouse Sam was not the only
salmon fisherman who survived a cruise with his upturned
boat on top of him. A man named Harriman
was capsized at the mouth of the Columbia River one
Friday at midnight, and when his craft was recovered,
on the Monday afternoon, the poor fellow and his boat
were high and dry on the beach. He was uninjured—in
fact, was soon feeling quite fit again, and, so far as
I know, he is fishing there to this day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Among the fishermen are a lot of English, Scotch,
and Irish, and some of the very best are Norwegians
and Danes. There are also many Italians and Greeks.
On the Columbia River the boats and nets belong to
the fishermen, while here on the Fraser the canneries
own all the vessels and gear. The pay is very good
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
while the work lasts, varying from 150 to 350 dollars
for a month and a half or two months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last year,” said Mr. Barker, referring to 1909,
“the pack was the highest in the history of the business,
and amounted to 5,340,000 cases. It was all readily
sold. The consumption of tinned salmon in this
country is increasing, of course, with the rapid growth
of population. Then, too, the English market is again
brisk, while we find it impossible to keep pace with
the demand from New Zealand and Australia, where
the salmon does not occur. This year we could have
sold five and a half million cases, but the pack only
reached a little over four millions. You may be surprised
to note the difference in the quantity caught and
canned in 1909 and the quantity caught and canned
in 1910. But that was a normal and expected difference.
The year 1901 witnessed a tremendous run of
salmon, as did the year 1905. There will be another
great supply of fish in 1913. It occurs every fourth
year with such absolute regularity that we prepare for
it by making an extra number of tins. Moreover, new
canneries are always set up in the recurring ‘fat’ year,
which is invariably followed by a ‘thin’ year. The
life history of the salmon—from the time spawn is laid
in the river to the return into that river of the full-grown
fish—is four years; and it is natural, therefore,
that the productiveness of each year should be echoed,
as it were, in the fourth following year, and in each
succeeding fourth year. That may or may not be the
explanation. Some people, indeed, seek to identify
the recurring ‘fat’ year and ‘lean’ year with a corresponding
variation in the rainfall. But whatever the
cause, it is constant and can be depended upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Apart from that fluctuation in the available quantity
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
of salmon, the supply of fish of almost all sorts
on the Pacific coast is beyond anyone’s power to
gauge. I have seen 35,000 salmon caught in one haul
of a seine net. That was in Alaska, where the bulk of
the salmon are caught. There is, of course, a tendency
for that fish to retire before the advance of a human
population. Pollution of the rivers is the actual cause
of that retirement, and in British Columbia pollution
takes the form of sawdust from the lumber industry.
Here, then, we touch the reason why, in my opinion,
the Fraser must rank as the finest salmon river in the
world. You simply cannot pollute the Fraser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man might try to describe the Rockies as he sees
them from the railway; but he could not succeed. Let
me content myself with an ungrateful reflection. The
through traveller in that astounding region is sated
with scenery—bored with beauty. A hundred grand
mountains, entrancing valleys, noble rivers, bewitching
glades, and glorious waterfalls—that quantity would
leave you still exclaiming, still in an extremity of
enthusiasm. But when you have experienced a sunny
day and starry night of peerless panorama, and find
there is yet more to come, a heaviness comes over your
senses. Because the eye has been debauched, the
numbed brain can no longer receive definite impressions.
In a feeble revolt, and hungry for contrast, you long
for a sight of something ugly, like a row of London
suburban villas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the mountains there are halting-places of
luxury, loveliness, and slippered ease. One of these is
Banff, where you may swim in an open-air bath of
sulphur water, which flows soft and warm from fiery
entrails of the earth. On certain stretches of the line,
trains pause beside pretty buildings, where fountains
play in gardens ablaze with blossoms, and where in
dainty observation-towers telescopes give you intimacy
with the stretches of eternal snow high overhead.

<p class='caption'>BIG TREES IN VANCOUVER, B.C.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Constantly in the hurrying waters of fairy rivers
one sees the dismembered trunks of trees—some jolting
onwards to be butchered into planks, the respited majority
stranded on rocky islands or sandy shores. The
trees of Canada are apt to excite one’s sympathy. You
pass acre upon acre of mountain side that has been swept
by prairie fires. They are a pathetic sight—those black,
leafless forests of carbon. Some of the abbreviated
trunks remain erect, some lean at perilous angles, some
are prostrate. The ground is strewn with ashes and
sorrow. In those regions of blackness and death, I saw
no moving thing, save only, on occasion, a yellow flying
grasshopper—a creature that flutters forward slowly,
makes a grating noise. Conspicuous among plants that
push their way through the desolate ashes is the great
willow herb, commonly called the “fire rod.” Settlers
tell you it appears only on land that has been swept
by fire; but there is another justification for the very
appropriate name. The spike of ruddy blossoms suggests
flame, while the clouds of feathery seed resemble
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The living forests are as inspiriting as the dead
forests are depressing. Canada has vast tracts dense
with majestic trees, which grow bolt upright to give one
another room. In the island of Vancouver, that richly
favoured region, I journeyed for hours, in the makeshift
rolling stock of a mining railway, through an interminable
paradise of lofty trees and lovely undergrowth.
Sometimes we zig-zagged on a switchback track right
up mountain sides; sometimes we crept cautiously along
the edges of deep ravines. Away beyond the forest-wrapped
island lay the Pacific Ocean—a broad stretch
of soft blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Man looks a poor little thing in a forest. But, while
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
incidentally unafraid of grizzly bears, he exercises over
the trees a dominion as absolute as it is tyrannical.
Far in the land of shadows and moss I came upon two
specimens of my species—mere dots of creatures less
than six feet high—who were assaulting a Douglas fir
which, with a girth of three yards, rose to an altitude
of over a hundred feet. This is what was happening:
Standing on spring boards lodged in the trunk some
four feet from the ground, they were working their
saw towards a V-shaped cut previously chopped on
the other side. I was encouraged by example to stand
a few yards from the toilers, and facing the back of
the saw. The tree, for all that it leaned slightly in our
direction, was destined to fall—everybody was positive—on
the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few years ago some men were felling a tall tree
in a London suburb, and they worked for many hours
with saws, axes and spades, likewise employing an
elaborate tackle of ropes; but in the end that tree
came down in an unintended direction, doing mischief
to a cab horse. My brain was busy with this memory
as, with head thrown back, I watched the top of the
Douglas fir. It was at least some comfort to reflect
that, if human judgment proved at fault, one would
see the thing coming, and there should be time to
dodge the danger. “She is moving,” someone said. I
watched intently. Yes, she was—but how gently,
slowly, and silently. No one spoke. Without a tremor,
that one tufted tree top went on moving softly towards
the other tufted tree tops that were motionless, and the
direction of the fall was fulfilling prophecy. In the
lapse of seconds, slowness became speed, and silence
gave place to thunder. Creaking and groaning, the
murdered monarch went crashing through the crowded
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
company of his fellows, who seemed to yell with pain
as their limbs were bruised and torn by the helpless
falling form, which struck the ground with the report
of cannon. Under the soles of my feet I felt the
earth heave, and then came the gentle patter of a shower
of branches.</p>

<p class='caption'>FRUIT-PICKING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Perspiration was streaming down the hairy chests of
the woodmen. They told me why they waste so long
a stump. The base of the tree is charged with resin,
which proves an obstacle to the saw. They also told
me that they can “throw” a tree in any direction with
precision. Man’s mastery over these wooden giants is,
indeed, complete. Elsewhere in the forest we saw a
felled tree of formidable dimensions girt about with
steel wire, which extended through the undergrowth to
a raised platform beside a railway line. Presently
from that platform there came the hullabaloo of escaping
steam and revolving wheels, the steel wire tightened,
and the huge bulk was hauled with contemptuous ease
through the wilderness of ferns and shrubs. At an
incline of stout logs some show of resistance was made,
but the engine gave a vicious snort, and the poor old
tree, jerked out of his momentary anchorage, was
dragged without ceremony on to the platform. Anon
we saw noble firs subjected to further indignities, they
being either towed or shoved by a locomotive along a
timbered track. Still later we beheld them drawn from
the water into a saw-mill, whence they emerged as clean
yellow planks, which were loaded into a steamer soon
to depart for Liverpool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are growing communities of luxurious families
who—in both senses of the phrase—live on fruit ranches
in British Columbia. They dwell in paradise, and find
it pays. But I have qualms about advertising their
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
felicity. The existence seems to be altogether too restful
and romantic to be deserved by mortal man. Instinctively
I find myself recommending to my friends the
prairie homestead rather than the British Columbia
orchard.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Life on the plains is delightful enough in all conscience.
It is good to wander in the sunny prairie,
looking at the flowers, birds, and insects. Swallows
and blackbirds occur in clouds. Pairs of milk-white
doves float amorously by. There are rooks far in excess
of the farmers’ wishes. You will occasionally see a
robin that is larger and lankier than the English kind,
suggesting a tiny eagle. In Eastern Canada I saw many
sparrows, and Professor George Bryce, of Winnipeg
College, told me these adventurous little immigrants
have spread across the continent within his memory.
They were introduced from England by ladies who, in
1880, made pets of them on Boston Common. Around
Portage la Prairie I saw humming birds—sprightly
scraps of gorgeousness. Prairie chickens and pin-tailed
grouse are never far to seek. On almost every stretch
of water you see cosy companies of wild duck among
the lilies and rushes; while geese, swans, pelicans,
herons and snipe may there be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In sheltered places the little garter snake makes his
home. When Winnipeg Penitentiary was being built,
the workmen discovered thousands of these harmless
reptiles in a neighbouring cave. Minks, weasels,
squirrels, badgers and gophers are common enough.
The gopher is a grey little creature something like a
rat and more like a squirrel. He has the queerest way
of squatting bolt upright upon his haunches, and staring
defiance at passing carriages and trains. Often he holds
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
a stalk of bearded grass in his mouth, and this gives
him a comical whiskered appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frequently in the great grain district one sees the
“French weed” (<span class='it'>Thlaspi arvense</span>), which seeds in silver
discs. It is the farmer’s chief pest, being highly prolific
and difficult to eradicate. In France, its native
land, this innocent-looking member of the mustard
family grows within decorous bounds, giving no trouble
to agriculturists, so that French visitors to Canada resent
the ill-will it there excites. The wild mustard, accidentally
introduced in wheat imported years ago for
cultivation, is another agricultural nuisance, though it
works less havoc than the native thistle—a bright-hued
offender. A while ago the Russian thistle filled farmers
with fear, but stern measures were taken, and it has
been exterminated. Many a flowery stretch of land owes
part of its beauty to the wild oat, a frail, fluffy growth
whose seed sails for miles at the impulse of the gentlest
breeze.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I think Canada’s chief charm is her people, with their
delightful freedom from snobbishness and their sense
of the dignity of labour. Prime Ministers of Provinces
give themselves no airs of superiority, and, so far as
manner is concerned, there is nothing to distinguish a
railway director from a railway porter. One class, however,
does seem to occupy a position of some superiority.
I refer to shoe-blacks. It is not in my heart to
begrudge them their exaltation of spirit. They are
artists. Canadians, not particularly concerned about
dress in a general way, have agreed in attaching great
importance to a well-polished boot. In the haphazard
British Isles almost anyone is considered capable of
applying blacking and brushes to footgear, but in
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
Canada the operation ranks as an art, whose professors
are understood to have been born with their special
aptitude. Britishers on a first visit to the Dominion
mechanically place their boots outside their bedroom
doors on retiring for the night. How the bell boys
smile! The desired end is not to be attained that way.
In the morning you must go yourself, with your boots
on your feet, to one of the palatial saloons where the
art is practised. The result, attained by protracted and
cunning exertions, is sure to surprise and please you.
Nay, in the joy of finding your boots transformed to
mirrors, it is likely you will not bewail the substantial
fee demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, by the way, a curious feature of the country
that it dispenses with small payments. A box of
matches, a newspaper, a tram ride—for each of these,
five cents is the charge. A bronze coinage exists, but
it can hardly be said to be used; indeed, in the west,
shopkeepers refuse to accept it. The only thing you
can buy for two cents, so far as my experience goes, is
a postage stamp of that value. But note the happy
significance of this disdain of coppers. Money is a
utility constantly accessible to all classes in Canada,
every form of manual and mental labour yielding in
that country an easy margin beyond the living wage:
wherein lies the difference between Great Britain on
one side of the Atlantic and Greater Britain on the other—between
the small country at the zenith of its development
and the large country that offers ever-widening
opportunities to industrious humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of what the Dominion is, and of what it will become,
I have attempted to afford some glimpses in this
book, which haply may assist in stimulating young
Britons to cross the sea and enter into their inheritance.
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
And with Canada’s expansion we may dream of the day
when our Empire, grown strongest on the North-American
continent, shall join with the sister democracy
of the United States in leading the world to
universal peace.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

For additional contact information:

    Dr. Gregory B. Newby
    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
